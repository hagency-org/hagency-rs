# Repository audit — 2026-09-05

## 2026-09-09 — Project names and revoke feedback

Verified Edison's prior revocation and the missing project-name projection.
Implemented observed Matrix name metadata, room-keyed labels, persisted departure
results, explicit retries and lost-response reconciliation.144 distinct tests,
production console build, scoped lint and fixture Playwright pass. Live names and
unchanged allocations verified; one unrelated usage read still returned502.
Native lifecycle boundary passes with five behavioral skips. Local idle services
restarted; no Palpo deployment, commit/push or canonical task mutation.
Details: docs/reviews/2026-09-09-engagement-console-recovery.md.

Latest update: the operator subsequently requested closing the findings. The fixes
and their evidence are recorded in the
[closure report](reviews/2026-09-05-review-closure.md), on
`fix/spec-review-closure`. Full Vitest passed **226 files / 3,783 tests**, with one
platform skip. Console fixtures passed **110 static/rendered and 39 browser
checks**; the final runtime passed **5/5 real-model continuity conversations**.
The CI wrapper passed; the final readiness persistence change passed its 18-test
closure suite. Agent-spec boundary verification passed with 21 lifecycle skips
because its verifier does not execute Vitest.
Claude Code Fable supplied two further independent static reviews, preserved
alongside the closure report. The full deployed workflow, external Agent
Operations release evidence and conflicting approval-channel decision remain open.

The text below records the preceding audit, before implementation.

This is an observation report, not canonical control-plane task state. The source
checkout has no provisioned `./task-writer` or agent-home project manifest.

Requested work: pull the latest HAFleet and assess completion against the planned
specification. `git pull --ff-only` advanced `master` from `0b1193d` to
`75ca1ecbf8c4623359094f000fa4968693f4a27e` in `/Users/yuechen/home/hagency`.
The checkout was initially clean. No implementation or test source was changed.

**Verdict: the project cannot be signed off as fully complete against its current
contracts.** Much is implemented and tested, but a reproduced behavior contradicts
the latest contract, acceptance coverage is incomplete, and release evidence is
still outstanding. This audit does not assign a completion percentage: passing
test counts are not a measure of fulfilled requirements.

## Findings

1. **Transport-provenance errors can be acknowledged instead of retried.**
   [The side-provenance contract](../specs/task-side-provenance.spec.md) (lines 54,
   114–125) requires missing, invalid, or inconsistent adapter provenance to produce
   retryable `invalid_transport_provenance`, HTTP 500, and no completed transaction,
   edge acknowledgement, or sync cursor advance. However,
   [lib/side-provenance.js](../lib/side-provenance.js) (lines 60–78) classifies an
   invalid mode, mismatched side, or mismatched registration as terminal
   `provenance_mismatch`. [bridge-matrix.js](../bridge-matrix.js) (lines 4401–4436)
   consumes that terminal result, allowing the receiver to remember the transaction
   and return 200. A local HTTP probe through the real listener, router, and bridge
   ingress, with a controlled internal provenance fault after authentication,
   reproduced 200 on both delivery and replay for all three inconsistent-context
   cases. Missing provenance correctly returned 500. Every case made zero typed
   business calls and zero event claims; the defect is acknowledgement/retry
   behavior, not demonstrated unauthorized execution. An internal wiring fault can
   therefore discard work that the contract requires retaining for retry.

2. **The side-provenance tests do not prove the promised scenario matrix.**
   The contract's binding instructions (line 57) require each of its 24 named
   scenarios through actual push, edge, and sync adapters. The test named
   `side_provenance_missing_or_inconsistent_context_keeps_batch_retryable` explicitly
   expects inconsistent provenance to succeed without throwing, contrary to its
   acceptance text ([tests/side-provenance.test.js](../tests/side-provenance.test.js),
   lines 165–201). The later `r5_all_spec_titles_across_edge_and_sync` test (lines
   1304–1365) loops over all 24 labels but uses the same valid-room, valid-credential,
   successful-message fixture each time; the label only changes the event ID. It
   does not inject the corresponding negative condition or multi-instance setup.
   These green checks cannot establish the required negative-case coverage.

3. **Executable contract bindings and requirement links have drifted.**
   Of 157 declared `Test:`/`Filter:` selectors, 13 match no registered test title.
   Some corresponding behavior exists under different names, so this is not a
   claim that all 13 behaviors are missing. Nevertheless, those exact acceptance
   bindings select no evidence. The sync-intake contract also declares
   `satisfies: REQ-AGENT-OPS-MATRIX-INTAKE`, for which no defining knowledge artifact
   or requirement statement was found. The checked-in traceability baseline is
   historical and cannot establish current coverage.

4. **Release completion remains unproven.**
   [The accepted thread-session requirement](../knowledge/requirements/req-thread-scoped-agent-sessions.md)
   requires a five-run, three-turn real-model continuity probe with at least four
   successes. [docs/THREAD-SESSIONS.md](THREAD-SESSIONS.md) (lines 3–10, 62–71)
   records a local canary but explicitly says this probe has not run and blocks
   non-local release. No superseding result was found in the reviewed repository.
   The [Agent Operations manifest](../specs/fixtures/agent-ops-client-v1/manifest.json)
   still has `release_status: "development"` and `source_commit: null`; its passing
   integrity check is not evidence of a released client contract.

5. **Local full regression verification is not clean.**
   `tests/api-engagement-room-admission.test.js` failed during fixture setup:
   `POST /api/framework-presets` expected 200 and received 404, before the selected
   room-withdrawal assertion ran. The exact test passed on an isolated rerun; the
   cause remains unresolved. `tests/hafleet-up-selfcheck.test.js` failed and failed
   again in isolation because lines 57, 59, and 76 hardcode `/usr/bin/tmux`, which
   does not exist on this Mac; the installed executable is `/opt/homebrew/bin/tmux`.
   The one skipped full-suite test is the non-macOS refusal case in
   `tests/install-macos.test.js`, skipped on macOS.

## Verification

The root dependencies were installed from the pulled lockfile using `npm ci`.
The ignored `remote-dist/` snapshot was initially stale and was rebuilt with
`npm run build:remote`; its subsequent checks passed. This was a generated-artifact
refresh, not a source fix. Local runtime: Node v24.10.0, npm 11.6.0, macOS.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Latest-commit GitHub CI | Lint and full-test jobs passed on Node 22.22.0: [run 33992646874](https://github.com/hagency-org/HAFleet/actions/runs/33992646874) |
| Full local `npm test`, with JSON reporter | 223 files: 221 passed, 2 failed; 3,702 tests passed, 2 failed, 1 skipped; 351.07 seconds |
| Separate Vitest run using the literal contract selectors as escaped name filters | 149 tests passed; 13 selectors matched no title. The 3,556 filtered/skipped tests are not passing evidence from this run |
| Syntax, ESLint undefined-identifier check, CLI contract | Passed |
| Architecture and dependency boundaries | Passed |
| Router typecheck, import boundary, generated build check | Passed |
| Remote source snapshot, source sync, generated package smoke | Passed after rebuilding ignored `remote-dist/` |
| Agent Operations artifact integrity | Passed, explicitly in development status |
| Contribution console `npm run verify` | 110 rendered/static checks and 39 browser checks passed against a temporary localhost fixture-mode console; this does not prove live backend integration |
| `npm run verify:ci` wrapper | Could not start: GNU `timeout`/`gtimeout` absent. Available static/build gates were run directly; no claim that the local wrapper passed |
| `agent-spec parse`, lint, lifecycle | Not run: `agent-spec` unavailable on PATH and absent from checked installation locations. The repository also documents the older Cargo-only lifecycle limitation for Node |
| Live Matrix/model/federation and deployment release checks | Not run; external behavior is not certified by the local fixture tests |

The temporary console was stopped after verification. Logs, JSON test reports,
the binding audit, and the local provenance-probe output are retained under
`/Users/yuechen/Library/Caches/hafleet-audit/2026-09-05/`.

### Contract binding inventory

“Resolved” means the selector matched an executed test title; it does not mean
the test proves every clause of its scenario, as finding 2 demonstrates.

| Contract | Resolved selectors | Declared selectors |
|---|---:|---:|
| Project baseline | 4 | 4 |
| Agent Operations client access | 18 | 18 |
| Appservice sync intake | 8 | 8 |
| Matrix DM privacy | 6 | 6 |
| Matrix thread continuity | 10 | 10 |
| Owner UI approval | 17 | 21 |
| Project board | 10 | 18 |
| Side provenance | 24 | 24 |
| Thread-scoped agent sessions | 47 | 48 |
| Total | 144 | 157 |

Unresolved selectors:

- Owner UI approval: `project room retains independent room-agent approval bindings`;
  `stale crypto store is archived before the token device starts syncing`;
  `launchers_keep_sandbox_defaults_and_wire_only_supported_adapters`;
  `repairs_identical_duplicate_sections_before_codex_parses_the_file`.
- Project board: `project_board_redacts_runtime_secrets_and_paths`;
  `project_board_groups_tasks_by_status`; `project_board_includes_related_task_graph`;
  `project_board_marks_stale_agent_task`; `project_page_renders_board_surfaces`;
  `project_board_proxy_is_read_only`; `project_page_coalesces_refresh`;
  `project_agents_link_to_the_monitor_and_monitor_has_complete_navigation`.
- Thread-scoped sessions: `runner workspace configuration requires operator authority`.

Scope interpretation: accepted `knowledge/` artifacts and the nine current specs
were the baseline. The console integration plan records P0–P4 as implemented.
The older PDU PRD is partly withdrawn and still contains unresolved scope questions;
withdrawn scheduler/pricing work was not counted as missing functionality. The
Octos/remote thread-runner expansion is explicitly a non-normative future roadmap,
so its exclusions were not treated as current implementation defects.

To reach sign-off, first align provenance retry behavior and its real adapter
tests with the accepted contract, repair or formally retire stale acceptance
bindings and resolve the dangling requirement link, address regression reliability
and the portable tmux lookup, then collect the required lifecycle and release
evidence. This audit did not implement those follow-up changes.

## Extended code review

The operator next requested a comprehensive review before live end-to-end testing,
and explicitly requested Claude Code Fable as an independent parallel reviewer.
The detailed findings, accepted-scope distinctions, coverage matrix and proposed
sign-off sequence are in
[the extended report](reviews/2026-09-05-spec-gap-review.md).

The local review added temporary backend API fixtures and real RouterStore/runner
process fixtures. Confirmed effects include leases released while processes can
still write; surviving runtime descendants; incorrect side/retired-agent selection;
unknown seat periods permitting auto-join; independent API keys merging into one
seat; active success despite a missing owner binding; and replay refused after the
original request consumes a side's allocation. A fresh-fleet request with a valid
resource preset still cannot provision its serving agent on approval. An HTTP push
probe also demonstrated that submitted body.mode controls the intake-mode metadata.
These probes used local fixtures and cleaned up their stores, sockets and processes.

Same-revision broad test/build evidence above was reused. No application or test
implementation was edited, and no live Matrix, remote mini, or real task-executing
model workflow was run. Claude Code was separately launched as the requested
reviewer with model claude-fable-5 and read-only file tools; it has no authority to
change the repo or contact project services. Review evidence is under
`/Users/yuechen/Library/Caches/hafleet-review/2026-09-05/`.

Claude Code Fable completed its independent static review successfully. Its original
output is preserved in [the Fable review](reviews/2026-09-05-claude-fable-review.md).
The consolidated report reconciles its findings rather than treating its conclusion
as test evidence. Additional fixtures reproduced ambiguous-token first-match
dispatch, requester-token room claims gaining whitelist admission, private owner/
configuration details in requester responses, and deletion of one side resolving
another side's identity alert. The side-removal membership-cleanup omission was
confirmed by source tracing. Accepted approval-channel documents still conflict;
cross-family review coherence and representative identity composition are documented
with their practical limits. The review is complete; implementation and live
remote-mini/Palpo/model testing remain separate follow-up work.


## Live remote Palpo and local Robrix2 UX verification — 2026-09-06 UTC

Following implementation closure commit `f89c746`, deployed an isolated remote
Palpo/DB/appservice edge and exercised local HAFleet with real Playwright Chrome and
native headless Robrix2. Earlier review entries above remain historical; the closure
commit fixes their bounded implementation findings, but does not establish live
workflow acceptance.

The live walkthrough finished with failures. Definitions, real room interaction,
request admission after setup recovery, explicit verdicts/revocation, whitelist
auto-admission/removal, budget refusal, tested authorization and uncertain-outcome
recovery passed. Fresh setup still needs out-of-band recovery. On-demand Claude
homes lack required MCP config; exposed messaging/lifecycle tools conflict with the
ephemeral allowlist; Codex stalls on unhandled MCP elicitation. Scoped create_task
produced a real child/thread, but no completed delegation or integrated artifact.
Native Agent Operations remains gated. These findings were recorded, not fixed in
this run. See [the live UX report](reviews/2026-09-06-live-ux.md).

No model dispatch remains queued/running. The coding task stays blocked, readiness
stays in_progress and the queued child was cancelled before start. Extra engagements
ended and the test whitelist was removed; two original engagements remain for
inspection. Existing remote services were preserved. Full evidence and host inventory
are kept privately outside this repository. Robrix gained an uncommitted isolated
profile override, with locked headless build and three exact/lifecycle tests passing;
no HAFleet application implementation changed during this live test.

## Fresh live closure in progress — 2026-09-06 UTC

The authorized follow-up repaired runtime MCP approval handling, scoped task and
peer tools, Claude home preparation, ordinary representative sync, private owner
validation, preset capacity, console allocation/approval controls and runtime
cleanup reporting. Claude Code Fable completed the requested independent review;
confirmed follow-ups are recorded in the current closure report. The stable full
suite after the test-server address-family isolation fix passed 234 files and
3,863 tests with one platform-specific skip. Earlier failed full runs and skipped
agent-spec lifecycle scenarios remain preserved.

A separate clean remote Palpo deployment and local runtime now pass fresh preset
creation, registration-token verification, native room creation, allocation, both
role requests and automatic home/Matrix membership fulfillment. The project bot
stays outside the room while representative intake routes the native task mention.
The real coding agent produced three passing tests. Native owner Deny produced an
encrypted Matrix verdict, was consumed as `owner_denied`, and created no child.

The same-turn retry then exposed a database uniqueness defect in approval waits;
that dispatch is `outcome_unknown`. Independent workspace inspection still finds
three passing tests and no README or child task. Console Stop rejects the fresh
thread agent because it lacks a legacy tmux session. Repairs and the allow,
delegation and integration retest continue. Source changes remain uncommitted.
See [the live closure report](reviews/2026-09-06-live-ux-closure.md); this entry does
not declare the workflow complete.

## Core live workflow verified; final client checks — 2026-09-06 UTC

The repaired original workflow completed real Codex implementation, encrypted
owner Deny followed by a fresh Allow, a real Claude documentation child, automatic
recovery of the unchanged scoped reply, parent integration and final Matrix
delivery. Both tasks are done. Independent tests and README/package examples
pass from the actual integrated project. The original approval retry and missing
peer-association failures remain in history, including the authenticated API
outcome-recovery step.

A subsequent native two-stage review completed without backend restart or outcome
recovery: the human thread follow-up became the child input, the binding used the
valid outer Matrix root, separate parent/child sessions executed, the child reply
automatically resumed the parent, and both tasks plus all four dispatches and
Matrix replies completed. Existing invalid nested-thread history was not rewritten.

The real browser Stop probe first exposed false success: an owned detached Node
subprocess survived and wrote 65.192 seconds after Stop. Observed-descendant
tracking and stopped-agent admission were repaired. A new native request/browser
approval provisioned a distinct agent without altering the old engagement,
binding or fence. Its live Stop retest removed the exact observed guardian,
Codex and detached Node processes. An independent check after the full timer
deadline found no completion marker, no late write and no active model dispatch.
The intentionally interrupted task remains blocked/uncertain and its workspace
quarantined. Portable process observation is not universal daemon containment.

HAFleet's later bounded checks pass, including 39 guardian/Stop tests and 116
admission/capacity tests; the earlier full-suite snapshot remains 3,863 passed and
one platform skip. The current agent-spec lifecycle remains non-passing with 15
behavioral skips. Native Robrix rendering, approval previews and drawer action
ownership also have real regression/build evidence. The last native member-cache
refresh retest is in progress. Changes remain uncommitted; the current closure
report separates live acceptance, historical failures and remaining project gates.

## Final native checks verified — 2026-09-06 UTC

The rebuilt Robrix app passes a live membership refresh check against Mini1:
the exact fixture account is absent before join, present after join, and absent
after leave in the same native process. Owned Matrix API calls provide fixture
setup only; no native invite acceptance is claimed. Original five-member project
topology is restored, the owner room was never mutated, and outsider history
access remains 403. The real SDK integration and 56 mention-widget tests pass;
its native lifecycle has two behavioral and one boundary pass with no skips.

Live Threads and Info toolbar actions now affect only the main project screen.
The mounted owner room and same-room thread remain unchanged after opening either
drawer and selecting a thread row; no foreign search modal appears. The actual
three-RoomScreen regression and its behavioral/boundary lifecycle also pass.
Private app-rendered captures and detailed receipts support both native checks.

Final read-only health finds Palpo responding 200, all 15 approval requests
consumed and no active or queued dispatch. Nine historical dispatches completed;
three remain outcome_unknown, including the preserved approval failure and two
intentional Stop probes. The current closure report is finalized for this scoped
workflow run. The project still lacks full signoff for the stated release,
approval-channel, runtime/recovery and HAFleet lifecycle requirements. Source
changes remain uncommitted; no PR or push was made.

## Operator manual web onboarding repaired — 2026-09-06

The operator's `sunwukong-01` home existed, but the shell launcher sourced repo
dotenv over an environment-only backend deployment and fetched its launch profile
from the wrong loopback instance (401). Both entrypoints now preserve the backend's
resolved environment. The launcher's exit cause survives an earlier missing-session
observation. Web onboarding now waits for real health, retains phase-specific
errors and supports retrying the same offline agent without reprovisioning.
Hard-coded restart/supervisor claims and the incorrect ACP remedy were removed
in both languages.

The real web retry passes: online, healthy, MCP present and the selected
`claude-opus-5` runtime. Agent identity, home, token fingerprint and selected preset
are unchanged. Only the exact requested name was added to the dedicated session
allowlist. Four red assertions were preserved; 36 focused and 86 related tests
pass, plus the isolated browser failure fixture and production build. All 230
selectors resolve. The bounded agent-spec lifecycle remains non-passing with four
behavioral skips and one boundary pass. See the
[manual onboarding recovery report](reviews/2026-09-06-sunwukong-onboarding.md).

## Operator desktop client connected — 2026-09-06

Built the current Robrix2 source for macOS and opened a visible desktop window
against the existing Mini1 Palpo deployment. The owned headless app exited
normally before the desktop reused its profile. The persisted login session is
unchanged; the existing account, project timeline and encrypted owner room loaded.
A targeted window capture and private launch receipt verify the visible result.
No new engagement request or approval was submitted during this launch.

## Palpo requirements drafted; operator walkthrough prepared — 2026-09-06

Wrote the requested draft covering Palpo-managed HAFleet admission, scoped
App Service registration, per-fleet reception rooms, verified project targeting,
provider approval and Matrix agent identity lifecycle. It separates upstream
API availability from deployed verification and preserves open approval-channel
and source-room contract questions. Existing accepted requirements are unchanged.

Prepared a six-step manual request/approval/task guide. Read-only prechecks find
the representative connection accepted, coding on offer, no pending engagement,
100k remaining allocation and the visible desktop Robrix2 process. A new coding
request is expected to provision a new agent; the local manually onboarded agent
has no project-side binding. No request or approval has yet been submitted in
this new walkthrough. Later steps remain explicitly pending.

The requirement is machine-readable as proposed, unplanned and unproven; its 23
clauses do not claim implementation coverage. Relative links and whitespace were
checked. The existing live-UX task contract parses and lints; the recorded
documentation-only lifecycle uses lint/boundary layers and remains non-passing
with 15 skipped behavioral scenarios. No runtime test pass is claimed by that run.

## Repeated command reply recovery and manual request diagnosis — 2026-09-06

Palpo and the local tunnel returned 200 while the representative received the
operator's new `!offer`. HAFleet derived the outbound transaction id from room
and reply text, so Palpo deduplicated the fresh answer against an earlier answer.
Five of six new deterministic tests failed before the repair. Reply identities
now include the authenticated input event, per-command reply position and content,
with asynchronous isolation for concurrent commands. Explicit durable send seeds
remain stable; calls without replay identity generate independent send identities.

All six regressions and 279 related tests in eight files pass. Syntax and
whitespace checks pass; all 236 spec selectors resolve. Agent-spec 1.4 parses and
lints the bounded contract at quality 1.0, but its native Node lifecycle remains
non-passing with three behavioral skips. Evidence is retained under the private
run cache's `command-reply-recovery/`. Only the owned local bridge was restarted;
Palpo was not changed. The bridge retained an older blocked history-gap record
with no proven boundary; no historical events were guessed or force-replayed.

A new encrypted owner-room `!offer` and visible desktop response verify current
bot delivery. The representative project-room regression still awaits a fresh
manual command. The operator also sent a coding request for 100,000 tokens and
20,000/day from the private approval room, rather than the intended project room.
Its target is therefore the approval room and it has no project owner binding;
the attempted approval left it pending and unbound. The assistant did not create,
approve, reject or retarget this request. The next manual step is to submit the
intended request from the project room and explicitly verify its private owner
binding before approval.

## Operator-created project room receives requests — 2026-09-06

The operator created a new invite-only, unencrypted project engagement room and
invited the existing representative, which joined through the normal collector.
The assistant performed read-only verification and did not create a duplicate
room or submit a request. Native operator `!offer` received a representative reply;
the operator then requested coding for 100,000 tokens and 20,000/day, and received
the pending-decision acknowledgement. These are the operator's actual amounts,
superseding the earlier walkthrough example of 10,000 and 2,000/day. The new room
requires an explicit owner/private-room binding on its first approval. Detailed
room and event receipts remain in the private cache's manual walkthrough folder.

## Existing customer project registered; approval form prepared — 2026-09-06

The operator encountered the server credential wizard while trying to establish
the new project's customer record. Read-only inspection confirms the existing
Mini1 side is accepted with a registration-token credential; its project metadata
list was empty. The current project request was pending with no fulfillment or
recorded binding failure. Registered the operator-created room under that existing
side through `POST /api/project-sides/:id/projects`, preserving credential kind,
issuance metadata, accepted status and allocation.

Verified that the borrower and representative are joined to the unencrypted
invite-only project, and that the existing separate approval room is encrypted,
invite-only and joined only by the borrower and fleet bot. Opened the new request's
approval form in the dedicated browser and filled its 100,000-token amount, exact
borrower MXID and private approval-room ID. No verdict request was sent; the request
remains pending and unallocated. The screenshot and readback receipt are in the
private manual walkthrough folder. This resolves the immediate setup confusion
using existing APIs; it does not claim a new project-management UI was implemented.

## First-project approval repaired and operator retry completed — 2026-09-06

The operator's repeated `owner_unavailable` result was a missing project-scoped
owner binding. Registering project metadata does not establish that binding, and
the old approval form allowed both ownership fields to remain empty inside a
collapsed section. Prefilling the dedicated testing browser did not repair the
operator's other browser. No request-body loss or unavailable Palpo was found.

The pending queue now reports owner setup readiness from the current requested
project's binding. First approvals open and require the explicit owner MXID and
separate private approval room; existing bindings remain reusable. A stale
`owner_unavailable` response retains its structured code and reopens required
setup with actionable bilingual guidance. No requester-derived ownership,
credential replacement or authority bypass was introduced. The bounded contract
is `specs/task-first-project-owner.spec.md`.

All three new regression selectors failed before the repair. Afterward, 78 tests
in five related files pass, all 239 spec selectors resolve, syntax/diff checks
pass and the production console builds. Isolated Playwright checks against the
built UI intercepted all API calls: missing fields send no verdict, complete
ownership reaches the payload, and a revoked binding reopens required setup.
Agent-spec 1.4 parse/lint pass at quality 0.95238095; its native lifecycle remains
non-passing with three behavioral skips. Separate Vitest evidence is not a native
lifecycle pass.

Rebuilt and restarted only the owned local backend and console. Using the actual
updated browser form, retried the operator's already-attempted 100,000-token,
20,000/day approval for the operator-created engagement room with the independently
verified borrower and encrypted private owner room. The real verdict returned
HTTP 200, active, bound and fulfillment complete; a fresh Codex gpt-5.6-sol/high
agent was created. Direct Palpo membership reads confirm the new identity joined
the intended project alongside the borrower and representative. The private
approval room remains encrypted with exactly borrower and fleet bot joined.
The refreshed console shows the new serving agent. The older request accidentally
submitted from the private approval room remains pending and was not changed.

Evidence is retained under the private run cache's `first-project-owner/`, including
browser regression receipts, actual approval request/response, Matrix readbacks,
console screenshots, build output and lifecycle results. No work message was sent
for the new agent: execution remains unverified. A separate initial runtime-display
gap remains: an eligible new thread agent with no session falls back to the legacy
tmux observer and reports offline/tmux-missing:auto. Its home and task-writer exist,
and no operator stop fence is set; this is not evidence of a completed task or a
healthy running process. Do not equate successful admission with execution signoff.

## Borrower approval receipt and representative loop guard — 2026-09-06

The operator still saw the original “awaiting a decision” Matrix acknowledgement.
Direct timeline reads proved that approval had emitted invite/join membership
events but no result message. Added `specs/task-engagement-approval-notice.spec.md`:
manual approval on a configured side commits pending notification intent alongside
allocation. The authenticated bridge materializes durable Matrix work and sends a
public receipt as that side's representative. It includes role, allocated tokens,
agent identity and serving configuration, and replies to the original request.
Private owner, credential and deployment fields are excluded. Transient failures
retry with one stable transaction identity; delivery requires a Matrix event ID.
Completed work and explicit verdict replay do not reallocate or duplicate receipts.
Revoked engagements are fenced before an unsent or expired-lease notice is claimed.
Unrelated historical approvals are not automatically backfilled.

Three of four initial scenario tests failed before implementation. The first
delivery implementation passed 223 tests in eight related files, but its real
Palpo receipt exposed an additional loop defect: the representative's own message
was parsed as human work because it contained the new agent's full Matrix ID.
This created an unintended task and runtime approval request. The receipt delivery
itself succeeded; the initial live no-work side-effect check FAILED. Do not count
that run as a clean notification acceptance.

Cancelled that exact dispatch through the operator API without granting its pending
execution approval. The runtime trace showed a failed bootstrap/task-writer attempt
and another task-writer attempt awaiting approval; no file-change items or workdir
files modified after the receipt were observed. Codex exit 143 was recorded. Used
the bound outcome-inspection flow with `keep_blocked`: the accidental task remains
blocked and the dispatch remains outcome_unknown with an explicit resolution;
it was not accepted as completed or replayed. The inspected workspace was released
for a future real borrower task. The bridge now ignores its recorded representative's
own output before control-command parsing and agent routing. All three new loop
fixtures failed before that guard and pass afterward, alongside 25 intake/reply
tests and 49 further provenance/ACL tests. Syntax, ESLint and whitespace checks pass;
all 244 spec selectors resolve. The final native agent-spec lifecycle is still
non-passing with five behavioral skips, despite independent passing Vitest runs.

Updated only the owned local backend/bridge processes. Replayed the already-active
operator verdict to recover this one historical missing receipt through the new
supported path. Direct borrower-authenticated Palpo reads verify the representative
receipt and its reply relation. The original approval timestamp, serving agent,
100,000-token allocation and side commitment were unchanged. Native Robrix was
scrolled to the latest messages and visibly renders “已批准 / Approved coding for
100000 tokens” with the actual agent and model. Final readback: engagement active
and bound, receipt delivered, agent idle/unblocked, zero live dispatches. Historical
pending acknowledgement and accidental-task messages remain as audit history.

Private evidence is under the run cache's `engagement-approval-notice/`: receipts,
native screenshots, red/green tests, lifecycle reports and the accidental dispatch's
cancel/inspection/resolution records. Successful execution of a newly submitted
borrower work task remains the next manual validation step.

## Parallel Matrix admin Web App started — 2026-09-06

At the operator's explicit request, delegated implementation to `palpo_admin_app`
in the independent `/Users/yuechen/home/palpo-admin-web` worktree on
`feat/hafleet-admin-web`. The agent located no local Palpo source, cloned upstream
at 3e4fbd33 and is implementing an initial `web-admin/` service against Palpo's actual
admin/Matrix APIs using the existing proposed HAFleet onboarding requirements.
Initial scope is administrator authentication, fleet/App Service management and
managed-agent identity CRUD with honest readiness reporting. This is ongoing work;
it is not deployed and does not change the current Mini1 server or shared HAFleet tree.

## HAFleet side of Palpo admin integration — 2026-09-06

Implemented the bounded `task-palpo-fleet-protocol` contract for the coordinator's
isolated admin deployment. The existing AS listener now exposes four narrowly
scoped v1 operations under the registration's own hs_token. Real push-only custom
probe receipts establish reception delivery; custom request events retain exact
sender/event/source/target identity and require the fleet's registered project
marker, target membership/invitation authority, room-admin owner, and separate
encrypted owner/bot approval room. Private approval room IDs remain outside the
plaintext reception event and public status. Current target authorization is
rechecked before allocation. Provider approval stays manual; direct-room requests
retain their existing rules. Approved results are queued to reception while agent
admission and work bindings remain attached to the verified target.

Added a registration JSON file import to the existing credential form: it validates
the selected server and exact fleet namespace, populates masked fields, displays
scope, and requires explicit Save. Verified ownership proposals prefill the operator
approval form without submitting a verdict. The production console build succeeds
under `HAFLEET_CONSOLE_DIST_DIR=.next-admin-e2e`, preserving the existing `.next`
build. The same environment setting is required at start.

Validation: one combined run passed 212 tests in 10 files; a subsequent four-test
API run added the target-admission/reception-queue check and passed all four,
covering 213 distinct relevant tests. Existing side-provenance coverage is 99 tests,
not 100. A first regression run exposed unconditional adapter invocation in partial
bridge fixtures; the production path was narrowed to the two custom event types
and the full suite passed afterward. Two new fixture assumptions were corrected
(the established guard returns 403, and bridge state lives under data/matrix).
Syntax, ESLint, architecture boundaries and whitespace checks pass. Native
agent-spec 1.4 parses/lints the contract at quality 1.0 but remains nonpassing with
eight behavioral skips; Vitest evidence is separate. No native skip is counted as
passing. Test/build/lifecycle receipts are saved in the private live-run cache's
`fleet-protocol/` directory.

Deployment and live Playwright acceptance belong to the coordinating task and are
not claimed here. Browser onboarding/resource approval plus a non-escalating task
does not validate the still-native private runtime approval UI. No live process,
room, credential or existing manual runtime was changed by this implementation
subtask. Protocol details are in `docs/design/palpo-fleet-protocol-v1.md`.

## 2026-09-06 — Palpo admin deployment and live Playwright acceptance (in progress)

- Deployed the separate `palpo-admin-web` worktree's Node web administration app
  to Mini1's dedicated closure Palpo Docker network. A loopback SSH tunnel exposes
  the app locally on 18080; reverse callback 19094 reaches isolated HAFleet AS18195.
- Real Playwright administrator sign-in and provider/project/outsider authentication
  isolation pass. Cross-owner pairing is rejected, administrator operations return
  403 to normal users, and scoped reads do not expose other owners' records.
- First real dynamic App Service installation exposes a Palpo server defect:
  registration/read-back succeed but ordinary AS token authentication uses a
  startup-only file cache. The failed registration remains durable and retries
  reuse its identity. The admin UI now preserves login on upstream AS401.
- A dedicated Palpo Rust worktree and isolated Linux builder/test PostgreSQL are
  validating the server fix before rollout. No startup-registration workaround
  or manual database mutation is counted as successful dynamic onboarding.
- The isolated local HAFleet console created a Codex contribution preset and Mini1
  project-side record through Playwright. Full connection, request, fulfillment
  and actual task execution remain pending the real server fix. A further default
  agent-prefix/import mismatch is being fixed before testing admission.
- Private evidence and credentials are under the operator cache
  `palpo-admin-e2e/2026-09-06`; source deployment artifacts live in
  `/Users/yuechen/home/palpo-admin-web/web-admin/deploy/`. Existing manual HAFleet
  runtime18193 and native Robrix remain separate. This is not full acceptance.

## 2026-09-06 — Imported fleet naming blocker closed

Imported Palpo registration credentials now determine a side-specific
`hf_<id>_agent_` prefix. Backend identity minting, on-demand provisioning, target
admission, withdrawal and roster authorization use that same scope; bridge
senders, member recognition and modern/HTML/text mentions agree. Legacy
registrations retain the configured global prefix. Inconsistent imported
namespace/sender pairs fail closed. No runtime environment override is needed.

The bounded contract is `specs/task-managed-fleet-identity.spec.md`. Nine focused
files pass 198 tests, including real temporary-home on-demand provisioning under
global `ac_`, assigned MXID registration/invite/join, foreign-fleet rejection and
legacy side regressions. An additional same-homeserver sender assertion passes
in the 14-test bridge intake suite. Syntax, ESLint, architecture boundaries,
256 spec selectors and whitespace checks pass. Native agent-spec 1.4 remains
nonpassing: three behavioral skips and one boundary pass (quality 0.9583); it
cannot execute these Node/Vitest scenarios. This does not claim live acceptance.

Evidence is preserved in the private live UX closure cache under
`managed-fleet-identity/`. No live service, existing credential, old runtime or
console build was changed by this backend/bridge fix. The deployment coordinator
can remove its temporary prefix override before restarting the isolated runtime.

## 2026-09-06 — Canonical completion after the Palpo browser task

Independent read-only inspection of the isolated admin E2E runtime confirmed one
manual engagement approval receipt delivered in reception, replying to the exact
request event. The borrower task created exactly one canonical task and dispatch;
the completed dispatch reply used the originating task thread. No representative
receipt or agent echo created another task. The agent generated the requested
files, but its task remained in_progress after a successful model turn.

Root cause: runner context did not require the explicit canonical task transition,
and provisioned task-writer still targeted legacy agent metadata. The runner now
requires verified work and a confirmed scoped done transition before reporting
completion. Within a complete authenticated ephemeral context, task-writer uses
/api/router/session-task for its own task; incomplete/expired authority cannot
fall back to legacy writes. Heartbeat, wait and resume preserve unfinished states.
A successful model turn alone still leaves its task open. Ordinary home and graph
commands retain their legacy paths. The existing home wrapper references the
updated script directly and needs no reprovisioning.

Five deterministic files pass 93 tests, including real CLI child processes against
the scoped backend under hard agent-token mode, foreign-task rejection, expired
capability rejection, explicit completion, waiting/resume and legacy behavior.
Router build/reproducibility, syntax, ESLint, architecture, 259 spec selectors and
whitespace checks pass. The extended Palpo protocol contract has native quality
1.0 but remains NONPASS with ten behavioral skips and one boundary pass. Native
Node scenarios are unsupported; Vitest results are separate. Evidence is in the
private live UX closure cache under canonical-task-completion/.

The coordinator owns restarting only isolated backend18194 and a genuine browser
follow-up to validate completion. No existing live task state was manually changed.
A separate observed health projection still combines router idle state with stale
tmux-missing/offline flags; this audit does not describe those flags as healthy.

## 2026-09-06 — Mentionless project-thread followup admission

The coordinator's real Element followup was received by the bridge but ignored as
unaddressed: it never entered router_messages or task_inputs and queued no new
dispatch. The original completed dispatch and reply remained intact. The failure
was recipient resolution before backend ingestion, not a running or stuck model.

Project-thread followups now ask the bridge-authenticated approval-binding read
for the exact room/root/full original requester. Only one unfinished canonical
task with a current approval binding may identify the recipient. The bridge also
requires current requester, representative and assigned-agent membership; unknown
or ambiguous roots, another requester, substituted lookup scope and revoked
agent admission fail closed. Plain unaddressed room messages keep their previous
behavior. No last-active-agent fallback or replay of the ignored event was added.

Six files pass 149 deterministic tests, including a fresh bridge with no thread
memory, canonical task lookup, foreign scope rejection, same-name requester on
another server, ambiguous bindings, legacy direct intake and side provenance.
Syntax, ESLint, architecture, 261 spec selectors and whitespace checks pass. Native
agent-spec quality is 1.0, with eleven unsupported behavioral skips and one
boundary pass; the lifecycle remains NONPASS. Private evidence is in the closure
cache's mentionless-thread-followup/ directory.

The coordinator owns isolated backend18194 and bridge18195 restarts and a new
genuine Element followup event. The first ignored event remains failed evidence.
No live messages, runtime-state edits or restarts were performed by this subtask.


## 2026-09-06 — Mini1 Palpo admin deployment and live acceptance completed

Deployed the web administration worktree to Mini1. The live Palpo baseline keeps
its existing dependency/schema version with the tested dynamic App Service auth
backport; the rollback container and database backup remain available. The admin
release is `palpo-web-admin:7568134cb58d3062`.

Real Playwright coverage passes administrator/owner/project sign-in, hot App
Service installation, scoped pairing and HAFleet credential import, real Matrix
push receipt, reception recovery, a separate target project and encrypted owner
approval room, published coding role, a manually pending request, HAFleet resource
approval and actual admitted agent identity. The project member used Element's
real composer to request code; the agent wrote real files and returned results in
the original thread. Five tests pass independently from the edited workdir.

The extended thread test closed two further defects: scoped task-writer lifecycle
updates and exact persisted-thread recipient lookup for mentionless replies.
After actual private owner approval, the same canonical task reached done; all
three dispatches settled with zero queued work or active leases. Approval receipts
return to the original reception event, while task results and private approval
information stay in their proper rooms. No self-dispatch or replay of the ignored
first followup occurred. Request idempotency/conflict, foreign-project refusal,
admin/backend restart persistence and live offer withdrawal/publication refresh
also pass. A separate second fleet proves identity/token/owner isolation and
identity lifecycle; it is revoked and its test identity retired.

This is NOT full pure-Playwright or full Proposed-spec acceptance. Element and the
Palpo admin lack private permission-card buttons. Shell and scoped MCP completion
both triggered real owner approval; text replies were verified insufficient. A
separate native Robrix profile performed the exact Approve once, after which the
final result was verified in the browser. That native step is recorded separately;
the consumed card's static Pending header is also a remaining presentation issue.
Credential rotation, coordinated runtime stop/retirement acknowledgement, complete
owner self-service/identity membership management, metering/health projection and
other draft coverage gaps remain explicit in the final report. No Node agent-spec
behavioral skip is counted as passing.

Validation checkpoints: admin 30 tests plus Chromium/live browser coverage;
HAFleet scoped lifecycle 93 tests and thread routing 149 tests (overlapping sets,
not summed); live-baseline Palpo PostgreSQL regression 1/1 and Linux arm64 build.
All original failures, the ignored thread input, expired/denied permissions, and
one refused extra request caused by an early harness ID-reset mistake are retained.
The corrected same-ID test verifies the explicit idempotency conflict. The extra
refused submission has no agent binding or quota allocation and remains unusable.

Final report and screenshots: operator-restricted cache
`palpo-admin-e2e/2026-09-06/acceptance-report.md`. Mini1 and the isolated local
HAFleet/Element services remain running; temporary native approval processes and
the dedicated build VM were stopped, with profiles/artifacts retained. The original
manual HAFleet runtime and Robrix session were not modified. No commit/push/reset.


## 2026-09-07 — Resource allocation operator walkthrough

Checked current live resources, project-side allocation, active engagement and
canonical task/usage state. Mini1 Palpo/admin containers remain healthy; expired
local SSH forwards were restored with an owned background control socket in the
private run cache, and a real push verification renewed the existing reception.
The operator's complete App Service walkthrough and role-specific account reference
are in private `palpo-admin-e2e/2026-09-06/` as
`resource-allocation-walkthrough.zh.md` and `walkthrough-accounts.md` (0600).

Observed: 200k resource declaration, 200k side cap, 100k committed, one done task.
The configured ceiling is not enforced, actual token usage is still unattributed,
busy time is unobserved for the ephemeral runner and project rollups remain partial.
The side's project summary is empty despite the valid Active engagement binding.
These are documented limitations, not zero usage or absence of the real project.


## 2026-09-07 — Operator requested restarting project-side onboarding

Removed only the isolated HAFleet18194 project-side record
`hfux-closure-20260906.test` / `Mini1 Palpo admin E2E` through the supported
DELETE endpoint with explicit force, as requested by the operator. The endpoint
returned 200 with cascade=performed: ended engagement `en_mtqrj5du_2459b5`,
released its 100k commitment, deactivated its owner binding, withdrew the agent
and representative from the project room, and retired the test agent. Records,
completed task and test artifacts remain. Palpo, remote App Service registration,
project rooms, resource preset and the separate manual HAFleet18193 are retained.

Verified the side list is empty, discovery reports alreadyASide=false and the
server reachable, the engagement is ended, agent.retiredAt exists and it is not
active, and actual Matrix membership is leave for both withdrawn identities.
Playwright reached the empty name field in step 2 without creating a new record.
Evidence: private cache `palpo-admin-e2e/2026-09-06/reset-project-side-*`.
The generic health observer overwrites offlineReason with tmux-missing:auto;
retiredAt remains the retirement truth and admission rejects retired agents.
No code change was made for that existing projection issue.


## 2026-09-07 — Remove preconfigured onboarding candidate

The operator still saw Mini1 after deleting the side because matrix/reach also
lists MATRIX_SERVER_NAME / MATRIX_HOMESERVER supplied by the test launcher.
Backed up private cache rig.py and removed homeserver defaults from its backend
process only, retaining the bridge's live connection configuration. All three
router dispatches were completed and no side existed before the owned backend
restart (new PID 67354, port18194). No repository code was changed.

Playwright verified zero candidates and empty manual fields, successfully probed
Mini1 after typing the server name/address, reached the empty step-2 name field,
and reloaded to an empty candidate list. It did not create a side. Matrix18010
and admin18080 both still answer HTTP200. Evidence is in private cache
palpo-admin-e2e/2026-09-06/reset-candidate-*.


## 2026-09-07 — Palpo import joined to the onboarding wizard

Implemented the operator-requested missing step directly in projects/new:
Appservice defaults to importing Palpo's existing authorization, previews its
actual representative/callback, and saves then verifies in the wizard. Retained
manual generation and registration tokens. Invalid/stale imports cannot write;
save and verification failures have distinct recovery paths; success does not
claim inbound reception readiness. Task contract:
specs/task-palpo-wizard-import.spec.md.

14 focused Vitest tests and four controlled Playwright scenarios pass; production
build and264 selector bindings pass. Agent-spec1.4 remains nonpassing with3
behavioral skips; its boundary passes. Deployed final .next-palpo-wizard-v2 to
console13202 (owned PID35312), stopped temporary13203. Actual Palpo owner download
and preview pass; the operator's 测试房间 1 remains without credentials so they can
click 保存并验证 themselves. Full scope/evidence:
reviews/2026-09-07-palpo-wizard-import.md. No commit/push.


## 2026-09-07 — Project-side visibility after App Service onboarding

The operator reported an empty Projects page after successful Palpo import.
Root cause: Projects consumed invitations and contribution bindings but omitted
the existing projectSides projection. Added a separate registered-side section
with server, representative, credential type/status and a connection/allocation
link. Missing credentials, failed verification, inactive state, loading and read
failure retain distinct meanings. Agent access lists remain unchanged.

15 focused Vitest tests pass and four controlled Playwright scenarios pass,
including English/Chinese visibility without agent grants, missing/inactive
credentials, empty registrations and failed reads. Production build, translation
parity, whitespace and265 selector bindings pass. Task:
specs/task-project-side-visibility.spec.md; agent-spec quality100%, boundary pass,
one unsupported behavioral skip (native lifecycle remains nonpassing).

Deployed .next-palpo-wizard-v3 to console13202 (PID13900) and stopped temporary13203.
Live Playwright confirms 测试房间 1 / 凭据已验证 with the actual representative;
the complete side object stayed unchanged (no allocation or grant was created).
Private evidence: projects-visibility-live.json, projects-side-after.png,
projects-visibility-browser.log and projects-visibility-lifecycle.json under the
palpo-admin-e2e/2026-09-06 cache. No commit/push.

During the fix, the operator asked how to log into Robrix2. Supplied the actual
provider Matrix ID/password and explicit local homeserver18010. The !Z3r... value
is the reception room ID, not a login ID. Provider membership was read and is
joined; no Matrix invitations, membership changes or native account switches
were performed. Robrix's password form supports separate user ID/password/server
inputs; no actual operator login error was supplied or reproduced.


### Project-side layout correction in final build v4

Visual inspection (and the operator's immediate report) caught a layout defect
that text-only browser assertions missed in v3: `.steps li` defines20px +1fr
columns, and its sole child occupied the20px marker column. Corrected that child
to span both columns and added an actual rendered-width regression assertion.
Four controlled browser checks pass again. Live Chinese screenshot on13202 now
measures1124px content width equal to the row, height151px rather than a vertical
column. Final deployed console is .next-palpo-wizard-v4, PID26554. Temporary13203
was stopped. The incorrect v3 screenshot is retained as
projects-side-after-v3-layout-failure.png; corrected evidence is
projects-side-after.png and projects-visibility-layout-v4.json. No backend state
or Matrix membership changed.


## 2026-09-07 — Palpo request form explains expired connection and delivery

The operator reported Send agent request produced no visible HAFleet engagement.
The new project owner channel was ready, but Palpo connection evidence had
expired; both inspected request and matching engagement lists were empty. The
form checked roles but ignored readiness and showed errors only at page top.
Fixed the Palpo web-admin worktree with inline readiness/recovery, owner-scoped
reverification, expiry gating, preserved request fields/ID and inline delivery
receipts. No allocation or replacement request was inferred or submitted.

30 Node tests, the existing browser workflow and six new Playwright recovery
scenarios pass. Deployed to the dedicated Mini1 web-admin container; live real
event verification succeeded at22:56:35Z after one honest probe_pending retry.
The existing reception/project remain and Send is enabled. Full findings and
evidence limits: reviews/2026-09-07-palpo-request-readiness.md. No commit/push.


## 2026-09-07 — Operator completed the octos-code-use single-agent task

The operator submitted Palpo request1ce1c56f-9d12-488f-b523-714d512e5540
for1,000,000tokens and200,000/day, then approved engagement
en_mtruf5yz_6c4bc1 in HAFleet. Fulfillment completed with the actual joined
agent mx_hfux_closure_20260906_te_coding_126926a91ba1. The operator sent the
sum(a,b) task through a real Robrix mention and manually approved its heartbeat
and done commands in the private encrypted owner room. Both verdicts were
allowed and consumed; no assistant verdict was submitted.

Independent verification from the edited agent project path reran
node --test sum.test.js:3passed,0failed,0skipped. HAFleet task API confirms
task_5cb9646b-ddc5-412c-8a7b-a1fdf92517f9 is done (23:10:15.118Z). The final
Matrix reply names the real files and belongs to the original project thread.
Evidence: private octos-sum-task-completion.json. This validates this manually
guided single-agent request/approval/task/result flow, not delegation, accurate
token metering or the complete proposed specification. Routine task-writer
heartbeat/done still trigger runtime permission prompts; this UX gap remains.


## 2026-09-07 — Recover the unanswered completed-thread Python follow-up

The real explicitly mentioned second message was received and queued, but its
canonical task was done, so the scheduler skipped it forever without a notice.
ADR-020 and the completed-thread-followup task contract implement a fresh-input
continuation of the unique task: exact original human sender, Matrix thread,
session, active binding, unprocessed supplementary input and never-started batch
are checked before atomically reopening and claiming. Prior dispatches and outputs
remain, with the prior completion and source input recorded in a router event.
Blocked, unknown, quarantined and running-work gates remain enforced.

114 related tests pass (six files), including an actual backend bridge-intake
regression. Router build/comparison, module boundary and270 spec selectors pass.
Native agent-spec retains5 unsupported behavioral skips and is not passing.
Deployed by gracefully restarting only the idle owned backend18194, PID67354
→52844. Its original queued dispatch20de23cb-830b-41f4-9d5b-ef986d5c062a started
at23:30:38Z using the same msg_0005 and session. No message was resent.

Python files were generated and3unittest checks independently pass. The model
then requested the owner's done approval; it remains a real manual gate, not
a fabricated test verdict. Current evidence and limits are recorded in
reviews/2026-09-07-completed-thread-followup.md and the private completed-followup
artifacts. No commit or push.

## 2026-09-07 — Repair routine task-maintenance approval

Added ADR-021 and a bounded contract, then reproduced five failing scenarios.
Fixed the ephemeral MCP heartbeat route, scoped execution field projection,
Codex lifecycle developer instructions and exact per-tool launch authorization.
The first real Codex probe found a further get_task confirmation gate; its
failure is retained. The second real probe created and tested code, then reported
heartbeat and confirmed canonical done with zero approvals. Independent tests
pass3/3. All92 related offline regressions pass; native agent-spec retains5
unsupported behavioral skips and is not passing.

After fresh idle checks and a consistent private SQLite backup, restarted only
the owned backend18194 from PID52844 to53826. Post-deployment API preserves all
five completed dispatches and the active Agent. The user's Python follow-up was
already done at23:38:00.660Z; no message replay or assistant owner verdict was
needed. Explained that Create Agent provisions a local worker, whereas the
Palpo application requests provider capacity and already provisioned this
project's Agent. Details: reviews/2026-09-07-task-maintenance-approval.md.
No commit or push.

## 2026-09-07 — Remove the independent provider Agent creation workflow

Operator confirmed Resource → borrower request → provider approval → automatic
Agent provisioning → management. Removed creation links, replaced /onboard with
a redirect, placed Resource configurations first and corrected both locales'
empty states and navigation counts. Backend provisioning and existing Agent
management remain available.31 Vitest tests and8 controlled Playwright scenarios
pass; the production build and278 spec bindings pass. Native agent-spec retains
3 unsupported behavioral skips, separately recorded as non-passing.

Deployed only console13202 as `.next-resource-first-v5`, PID90451. Real browser
checks confirm redirection and the current Agent detail, with zero writes and
the same two Agent identities/preset bindings. Evidence and limits are recorded
in reviews/2026-09-07-resource-first-console.md. No commit or push.

## 2026-09-07 — Project discussion context and mentionless private chat

Implemented ADR-023 and its bounded task contract: durable room history,
per-room/agent successful positions, frozen dispatch ranges and fenced paginated
MCP reads. Project discussion and public agent replies are context; explicit
mentions are required to start work, including in project task threads.
Native two-person DM admission retains existing project allocation and approval
authority. Dedicated App Service agent device sessions support encrypted intake
and replies, persistent history retry and conversation continuity after done or
restart. No global tool or network permission was introduced.

746 tests in40 files pass, as do router build/output comparison, scoped ESLint,
architecture ownership, remote MCP synchronization and286 specification bindings.
The native agent-spec lifecycle retains8 unsupported behavioral skips and is
recorded as non-passing, with separate Vitest evidence. Actual Playwright sends
against Mini1 Palpo verify multiple participants' discussion, successive mention
summaries, recovery of the user's original Robrix2 DM, and encrypted private
conversation across three turns and a service restart. The browser visibly
decrypts replies that are encrypted on the wire. Private content is absent from
the project archive; no new operation approvals were created. Removed the
temporary test member and confirmed the original project membership.

After idle checks and consistent private database backups, gracefully deployed
backend18194 PID75564 and bridge18195 PID75727. Console13202 remains v5. Evidence,
scope limits and the user guide are in reviews/2026-09-07-matrix-conversations.md
and guides/matrix-conversations.zh.md. No root task-writer exists in this source
checkout; no canonical task state was fabricated. No commit or push.

## 2026-09-08 — Diagnose second Agent request workflow

Confirmed the operator's new medium-reasoning resource exists and qualifies for
coding. Inspected the actual Palpo request form with Playwright: `octos-code-use`
is its target project, while `coding` is the only published role. Read the request
matching and fulfillment paths: they reuse an existing qualifying Agent, and
the operator approval form/API has no explicit resource or new-Agent selection.
This is an unresolved product gap despite support for multiple Agents in a
project room. Recorded the limitation without creating a manual Agent workaround
or submitting the operator's next request. Palpo connection verification is
expired and must be renewed before a future submission. No implementation or
service state changed; private read-only browser evidence was saved.

## 2026-09-08 — Resource-owned Agent definitions and explicit approval choice

Implemented the operator's revised flow under ADR-024: multiple Resources, each
with multiple named Agent definitions; explicit resource catalog publication;
and a validated definition/existing-Agent choice at provider approval. Defining
an Agent creates no runtime home or Matrix identity. Approval provisions the
selected definition with its resource profile and retains that identity across
interrupted fulfillment and retry. Existing project-side budgets still apply.
Palpo web-admin now displays the published resources and Agent definitions while
requesting the role; exact allocation remains the provider's approval decision.

105 related Vitest tests pass in 10 files; the updated proxy suite's 11 tests
also pass after adding exact route/security coverage. Two new bilingual and
eight existing controlled browser flows pass. Palpo's 31 Node tests and both
browser suites pass. Production build, scoped lint, architecture ownership and
290 selector bindings pass. Native agent-spec reports four unsupported behavior
skips and remains non-passing; separate Vitest evidence is retained.

Deployed backend18194 PID89234, console13202 PID31288 with isolated build
`.next-resource-agents-v8`, and Mini1 Palpo web-admin image
`palpo-web-admin:318f47082b8092da`. Bridge18195 and Matrix device state were
preserved. Actual Playwright creation of two temporary definitions through the
HAFleet console and publication to Mini1 Palpo passed. Removed only the test
resource/definitions and verified all three original Resources, Agent identities
and engagement allocations unchanged. No second real request or approval was
submitted and no budget increased. The project's 1M allocation is fully committed
to the first Agent, which is a prerequisite for the operator's next request.

Guide: guides/resource-agents.zh.md. Evidence and limits:
reviews/2026-09-08-resource-agent-definitions.md. No root task-writer exists in
this source checkout; no canonical task state was fabricated. No commit or push.

## 2026-09-08 — Correct definition ownership to the Palpo project side

The operator clarified that all project Agent definitions are made on Palpo.
Implemented ADR-025: removed HAFleet's definition form/proxy writes, retained
Resource configuration/publication, added Palpo Agent name and resource selection,
and bound that definition through Matrix source verification and request replay.
HAFleet approves the exact requested definition and provisions a distinct Agent;
it does not require a local definition or silently reuse the first Agent.

115 related Vitest tests in13 files pass, as do two corrected bilingual HAFleet
browser flows, eight existing Resource browser flows,33 Palpo Node tests and both
Palpo browser suites. Build, scoped lint, architecture and294 selectors pass.
Native lifecycle retains four unsupported behavioral skips, not a passing result.
Tests retain real backend provisioning with localhost Matrix and controlled launch
evidence; live UI inspection does not submit or approve an extra real request.

Deployed local backend18194 PID20010, bridge18195 PID20071 and console13202 PID20150
with `.next-resource-agents-v9`, plus the revised Mini1 Palpo web-admin. Before and
after restart, both existing Agents, three Resources, allocations and18 completed
dispatches are unchanged. The private run cache retains backups, exact image
receipt and verification evidence. Revised guide: guides/resource-agents.zh.md;
review: reviews/2026-09-08-palpo-agent-definitions.md. No commit or push.

## 2026-09-08 — Expose the actual resource pool and automate publication

Published the operator's three actual Resources and five currently supported
roles. Reworked Palpo's Agent request flow to display a deduplicated resource pool
first; choosing a resource then limits Role to what it can provide. The medium
Resource supports coding/testing/integration/documentation; high also supports
architect. Review still requires the existing cross-family qualification.

The operator then required automatic publication. New resource creation now saves
its default publication choice atomically. The Palpo callback derives roles from
qualifying published Resources without requiring manual role offers. Explicit
resource/role withdrawal remains effective, and this projection does not enable
automatic acceptance. Palpo polls the catalog every10 seconds while visible and
on return, preserves request drafts and refuses submission on failed reads.

110 backend regression tests passed in9 files;33 Palpo Node tests, both Palpo
browser suites, two bilingual HAFleet flows, production build, scoped lint,
architecture boundaries and296 selector bindings pass. Native agent-spec retains
six unsupported behavioral skips and is non-passing; separate Vitest evidence is
recorded. The exact bound source-authentication selector is checked separately.

Deployed backend18194 PID40252, console13202 PID40253 with
`.next-resource-pool-v10`, and Mini1 web-admin image
`palpo-web-admin:f67999ec23458a6a`. Preserved bridge18195 PID20071. Actual Playwright
creation via HAFleet's web wizard appeared in the already-open Palpo after9311ms
without manual publication or refresh. Deletion also propagated automatically and
retained draft inputs. Cleaned only the temporary Resource; verified all three
real Resources, both existing Agents, allocations and18 completed dispatches are
unchanged. No actual request, approval or budget increase. No commit or push.

## 2026-09-08 — Restore Send agent request readiness

Read the actual Palpo session, catalog and project state after the operator
reported a disabled Send button. The project and all three Resources were
available; connection verification had expired. The first real reconnect returned
probe_pending before Matrix asynchronously delivered its event. The original
browser verification script timed out waiting for success and is recorded as
failed; retrying the same probe succeeded without replacing rooms or credentials.
The Send button is now enabled after choosing the medium Resource.

Fixed the companion Palpo backend to wait for an authentic probe receipt, retrying
only probe_pending at500ms intervals (20 attempts maximum) with the same event and
challenge. Other errors fail immediately. A pause/revocation while verification
is in flight remains authoritative.35 Node tests and both browser suites pass;
syntax and diff checks pass. Deployed Mini1 image
`palpo-web-admin:b26d42db1b711ca9`. A single real Playwright click now verifies
actual Matrix delivery successfully in1207ms, preserves the request draft and
enables Send. The existing one active Palpo request is unchanged.

The project's1M-token allocation remains fully committed to the first Agent.
Requested the operator's intended second-Agent token amount before changing that
budget. No new Agent request or approval was submitted during diagnosis.

## 2026-09-08 — Separate Palpo definition intake from resource approval

The operator's fresh-resource request exposed the misplaced side-budget check:
Palpo definitions always need manual review, yet intake applied the gate for
possible automatic admission. Updated ADR-025 and the active contract, reproduced
the exact refusal in a regression, then exempted only authenticated fleet intake
from this pre-recording budget check. Approval/reservation still checks project,
resource and seat budgets. Existing automatic admission remains gated.

61 tests pass in5 relevant suites, covering fresh-resource pending definitions,
no headroom or assigned budget, replay without allocation, refusal at approval,
and later correctly funded approval. Syntax, scoped lint, architecture and297
selector bindings pass. Native lifecycle has seven unsupported behavioral skips,
zero failures, and is recorded as non-passing.

Deployed backend18194 PID16597 with private runtime backups. Console13202 PID40253,
bridge18195 PID20071 and Mini1 Palpo web-admin b26d42db1b711ca9 were preserved.
Retried the original edison request using Playwright. Palpo acknowledged201;
the initial verification script incorrectly asserted200 and failed after the
successful submission. Corrected the assertion and completed read-only verification
without resubmitting. The original event/ID/definition is preserved, and
HAFleet now has one pending integration request for edison,100000 tokens on the
medium Resource. Actual HAFleet web review opens the correct definition.

No approval, runtime creation or budget increase occurred. Both existing
identities, all three Resources, allocations and18 completed dispatches are
unchanged. The side's1M allocation remains fully committed, to be addressed before
approval. No commit or push. Evidence: palpo-pending-live-result.json,
palpo-pending-deployment.json and the Palpo/HAFleet screenshots in the private cache.

## 2026-09-08 — Fund the operator's concrete edison approval attempt

The operator supplied the actual approval refusal for100000 tokens while pointing
out the new medium Resource's100M ceiling. Confirmed that candidate has99M capacity;
the separate project-side total was1M, committed1M, remaining0. Raised only that
side's allocation to1100000 through its operator API to cover this approval amount.
Readback confirms committed1M, available100000 and edison still pending without any
reserved tokens or Agent. No verdict, model run, code change or service restart.
Existing first-Agent allocation is unchanged. This supersedes the earlier zero
headroom state and leaves approval to the operator.

## 2026-09-08 — Correct Edison's selected-pool accounting

The operator rejected the side-cap workaround. Updated ADR-025 and its Task
Contract, reproduced independent pool capacity failures, and corrected approval
to draw project-defined Agents from their selected Resource. Pool and shared-seat
commitments are separate; declared account quotas remain enforced. Legacy requests
retain side caps, with separate reporting for pool-funded commitments. Approval
shows both limits. Pending, active and reserved capacity share the store predicate;
concurrent approvals and retry cannot duplicate allocations.

275 distinct Vitest checks pass, plus both language Playwright fixtures. Production
console build, syntax, lint, architecture and299 bindings pass. Native lifecycle
reports9 unsupported behavioral skips,0 failures, non-passing. Details and the
initial red regression are recorded in reviews/2026-09-08-palpo-pool-accounting.md.

Deployed backend4587 and console4681 (.next-pool-budget-v11) to the existing local
rig. Bridge20071 and Mini1 Palpo are preserved. Real browser review confirms
edison medium100M/0/100M with100k requested, pending and not provisioned. No live
approval, budget change or model invocation. Two identities, three Resources,
18 completed dispatches and the prior1.1M side cap are unchanged. The side cap
is retained for legacy requests and no longer gates edison. Private deployment
backups and edison-selected-pool-fixed.json/png contain the readback evidence.

## 2026-09-08 — Verify rooms after operator approval

Edison is now active with completed fulfillment. Verified real Matrix membership:
it joined octos-code-use, while Reception received the representative’s delivered
approval receipt and has no Edison membership. Both the original Agent and Edison
are in the project room. Read-only check; no message, invite or approval submitted.
Evidence: edison-room-membership.json in the private Palpo admin E2E cache.

## 2026-09-08 — Invite existing Agents and render Matrix Markdown

Implemented the operator's correction in ADR-023 and its Task Contract. Ordinary
invitations use per-room per-Agent bindings to existing allocations; DM promotion
requires mentions, isolates prior private context and retains group thread
relations. Multiple addressed Agents consume one authenticated event through
separate tasks and send using their own identities. Revoked/departed bindings
cannot block another valid participant. Markdown is converted to safe Matrix
formatted HTML at the HAFleet send boundary, retaining plaintext and encryption.

179 regressions across13 suites pass, with router build/generated output, lint,
architecture and302 selector bindings. Native lifecycle reports0 failed and11
unsupported behavioral skips, non-passing. Deployed backend65390 and bridge75228
after preserving the complete runtime; console4681 and Mini1 Palpo are unchanged.

Mini1 live testing created two explicitly named test rooms, admitted Edison and
coding, verified implicit DM replies, ordinary invitations, DM-to-group promotion,
no unmentioned dispatch, individual and simultaneous mentions, background-context
summarization, identity and thread relations. Five new model dispatches completed;
all25 dispatches are complete. Playwright opened actual Element Web DM/thread
messages and asserted headings, bold, lists, links and code for both Agents.
Existing identities, Resource definitions and allocated budgets are unchanged.
No native Robrix rerun or live encrypted-room rerun is claimed. Full evidence and
limits: reviews/2026-09-08-invited-agent-rooms-markdown.md. No commit or push.

## 2026-09-08 — Restore and supervise Mini1 connectivity

Reproduced both operator-reported Robrix history requests as connection refused:
local18010/18080 and mini1-tunnel.sock were absent. Mini1 SSH and Palpo containers
were healthy. Restored all existing forward directions through a per-user launchd
service, with KeepAlive,15s SSH liveness checks and explicit foreground/no-persist
options overriding the user's ControlPersist600 setting. No Palpo, HAFleet or
Robrix code change or room-data modification was needed.

The exact thread URL returns4 relations. The exact ordinary-history cursor returns
an empty successful page because it is already at the start; fetching its current
history returns13 events including4 messages. A controlled tunnel SIGTERM caused
automatic recovery in0.48s; launchd owns the replacement PID99248. Both original
URLs pass again, and Playwright opens the real room and its thread successfully.
Reverse callback TCP connectivity also returns the bridge's authentication403
(reachability evidence, not an unauthenticated health-check success).

Service: /Users/yuechen/Library/LaunchAgents/com.hafleet.mini1-tunnel.plist.
Private cache evidence: mini1-history-connectivity-recovery.json,
mini1-tunnel-restart-test.json and mini1-recovered-history-browser.png.

## 2026-09-08 — Open Mini1 Palpo on the operator's public domain

The operator requested public access and specified crew.ominix.io on a separate
port. Confirmed DNS points to the configured Mini1 host, its certificate is valid, and18443
is occupied by an unrelated service. Added crew.ominix.io:19443 to the existing
/etc/caddy/Caddyfile, retaining all prior routes and gracefully reloading the
existing io.ominix.caddy process. Backed up the original configuration first.
Only Matrix client/media and client discovery endpoints are exposed; original
443website, Palpo containers, account IDs, rooms and local integrations remain.

Public HTTPS from this computer and Chrome validates TLS1.3 and the correct domain
certificate. A temporary real provider login succeeded; whoami,9joined rooms,
sync,13history events and4thread relations all returned200. The temporary session
was logged out. No native Robrix restart or credential/profile edit was performed.
Robrix can now use https://crew.ominix.io:19443 directly; the old local forward
remains for existing clients and HAFleet's callback. See the public connection
guide and private mini1-public-matrix deployment/verification evidence.

## 2026-09-08 — Agent names and visible runner activity

Accepted ADR-026 and task-visible-runner-activity. Repaired Edison's generated
Matrix display name without changing its MXID. Added native Codex/Claude tool
activity, fenced durable status projection, coalesced Matrix edits, periodic
liveness, approval/terminal state and context exclusion. Custom names and existing
sandbox/approval policies are preserved. DM edits retain encryption and reject
private-thread edits after room promotion.

161 distinct tests across 14 suites pass. Native agent-spec lifecycle has one
boundary pass and five unsupported skips, explicitly non-passing. Full runtime
backup preceded a graceful restart after the user's current execution finished:
backend95185, bridge95205. Live Mini1 DM plus a two-Agent thread completed three
real Codex dispatches with one editable status each and 19 acknowledged updates.
See docs/reviews/2026-09-08-runner-activity.md and the private rig evidence.

## 2026-09-08 — Bidirectional Agent files

Implemented and deployed ADR-027/session-file-delivery: managed MCP files in the
current room/thread/DM, immutable durable output snapshots, prepared media retry,
current sender admission, encrypted media/message delivery, bounded member upload
staging, readable conversation attachment metadata and scoped receive_file.
Group mention gating and DM no-mention behavior are preserved; file failures are
explicit, and filename text is not interpreted as a bot command.

141 focused tests passed across 11 suites, with subsequent tampered ciphertext
and undeclared oversized stream checks passing. Syntax, lint, route/architecture,
router build consistency, remote sync and spec bindings passed. Native lifecycle:
one boundary pass, six unsupported skips (non-passing). Local backend99858 and
bridge99880 deployed after idle check and full runtime backup. Real group, plain
DM and encrypted DM CSV→Agent→TXT workflows passed server/public download hashes
and Playwright actual attachment downloads. Corrected the isolated Element test
server CSP for its own sandboxed download helper. Palpo and Robrix source and
containers were unchanged. See docs/reviews/2026-09-08-session-files.md.

## 2026-09-08 afternoon — Robrix permanent attachment spinner

Reproduced the native client's picker panic and independent empty-filename
directory write failure from the user's actual desktop log. Fixed Robrix's Save
picker threading, unified links/buttons through authenticated SDK media with full
encryption metadata, added a bounded network timeout, and removed the obsolete
encrypted-download unsupported display. Code changes are in the actual Robrix2
source repo; unrelated existing work was preserved.

Five focused native tests and native build/check passed. Final native agent-spec
lifecycle is 3 pass, 0 fail/skip/uncertain; original transient HTTP fixture failure
and diagnostic reruns remain recorded. Actual native UI cancellation/retry and
group/plain-DM/encrypted-DM downloads passed, with four saved files hashing to the
expected total=8 newline payload. Updated/restarted Robrix2 Mini1 after preserving
the original executable/profile; final PID22930. No Palpo/HAFleet restart or code
change for this fix. Native screenshots, files and checks are in the private rig's
robrix-files-native-0908 evidence directory. No task-writer wrapper is provisioned
at this source repository root; no canonical task completion was fabricated.

## 2026-09-08 — YOLO and persistent scoped approvals

Implemented resource-default and per-Agent execution settings, exact native
task/always grants, atomic rule persistence, contributor revocation, and native
Robrix scoped cards. Added durable task completion epochs to prevent grant
revival on thread follow-ups. Default and existing Agent policies remain sandboxed.
154 focused HAFleet tests, 35 native approval tests, bilingual Playwright flows,
builds and required code checks passed. HAFleet native lifecycle retains five
Vitest-related skips; Robrix's two scoped scenarios pass. Live Mini1 encrypted
card click, fresh-runner rule reuse, webpage revocation/reapproval and isolated
real Codex YOLO verified. Initial shell-mode mismatch and blocked-task probe
timeouts preserved in evidence. Deployed locally after idle check and backup;
no Palpo changes, commits or PRs. Review: docs/reviews/2026-09-08-execution-authorization.md.

## 2026-09-06 macOS E2E

Operator requested Computer Use E2E with local Docker Palpo only, formal GUI @ member selection, and mempal disabled only for this E2E agent. Source baselines: HAFleet 0a0ae88, Palpo 8433b4a1, Robrix2 e28e118e. Palpo and PostgreSQL run in isolated Compose project hafleet-e2e at 127.0.0.1:8008; existing 8128 deployment is untouched. Palpo Docker source build and Robrix release build passed. Runtime: `~/.hafleet/e2e`; full evidence and per-layer RESULT.md: `~/.octos/outer/verify/e2e-{1,2,3}`.

GUI request/verdict/@ picker/real nonce reply passed. API isolation and recovery cases have explicit verified/partial ratings. F07 agent-leave test produced the expected warning in project 2; agent membership was restored in Matrix and HAFleet, confirmed in the GUI picker, and a test-end note posted.

Real thread runner launched Herdr session hafleet-agents-e2e, pane w1:p1, octoscode inner. Hello CLI implementation commit 0ad443b has four passing tests. Initial autonomous monitoring failed to recognize in-place ACK and the actual completion label, requiring intervention. Subsequent fresh-nonce E2EAUTOWATCH20260906A recheck completed autonomously through agent-authored monitoring, independent testing and a reply to the same Matrix thread; Codex only observed. mempal Stop hook and MCP are excluded by E2E-only wrappers for headless and ordinary tmux sessions; global settings hash is unchanged.

Source fixes: common startup now drains router outboxes without bot login; limited sync recovery now persists cursor bounds, pages the correct interval, validates complete responses, preserves failed/legacy recovery, and routes only messages through the authenticated router. Original 45-message burst delivered only 22; corrected live retest delivered all 45, including recovery after a real history-read rate limit. Red/green tests and independent review are recorded. Final regression/CI and commit evidence are linked in E2E-3 RESULT.md and `.octos/OUTER_LOOP_REVIEW.md`.

Remaining product gaps are not passing: task stays in_progress because legacy task lifecycle MCP is unavailable to the session runner; botless SSE membership path has misleading success logging after bot-client failure; task-title mention truncation. No state was manually changed to make lifecycle appear complete, and remote/ was not edited.

This checkout has no projects/, task-writer, or provisioned control-plane task object. No canonical task state was fabricated. These docs are coordination notes only.

## 2026-09-06 three-layer repair and autonomous retest

Operator authorized repairs and another autonomous test, preserving local Docker Palpo and E2E-only mempal isolation. Source work continues from 3a0ae55 on fix/botless-thread-outbox. Added scoped runner task operations with transactional receipts and authentication regression coverage; repaired botless same-side membership and promoted title extraction; added the reusable hafleet-inner-loop skill, bounded monitor and complete directory installation. Independent code review and schema 8-to-9 preservation checks passed.

Local API-driven run E2EREPAIR20260906A completed autonomously: Claude decomposed acceptance, started a real octoscode in named Herdr session hafleet-repair-e2e, resolved its own instance-lock startup failure, prepared a fresh monitored job, independently verified commit 58ef12b (9 tests plus CLI/fmt/clippy checks), commented evidence and transitioned task task_c52a2495-bec0-4410-a433-6088512c39ae to done. Dispatch a4d3fc89-5650-44d3-9c3c-d93288c85e79 separately completed. Agent reply $pZflpDMDS--xp6CUxKfpUsodg-foTo1sEGXSYPHf0xc reached original Matrix thread $MoYTvt4cPWI031B4Iz1xRcwB4DuAR5B6aARTctIcqs4. The driver only observed after sending the request. Old Herdr sessions and historical task states were preserved.

Project 2 HAFleet remove/add caused actual Matrix leave/join without manual invitation repair. New Computer Use GUI retest remains unverified: Robrix/Finder return -10005 cgWindowNotFound, while app discovery reports them running; operator desktop-readiness input is pending. Codex middle-agent coverage and final CI are being completed separately. Two intermittent CI failures (retention socket hangup and server-list HTTP 401) are retained in evidence; exact reruns passed and the latter now preserves response diagnostics without changing auth or adding retries. No root-cause fix is claimed for these intermittent failures.

Evidence: `~/.octos/outer/verify/e2e-repair-20260906/`. Agent-spec checks boundaries but skips Node scenarios; exact Vitest selectors are the executable verification, and skipped lifecycle scenarios are not passing.

Deeper rechecks supersede the initial project-2 snapshot rating: e2e-claude joined at 03:38:02.642Z but was kicked again at 03:38:05.217Z by a delayed Matrix-membership -> backend-roster -> SSE -> Matrix-operation echo. The later e2e-codex addition was unrelated. The original immediate join evidence remains intact; membership convergence is failed pending the source repair and sustained recheck. Codex's first actual dispatch also stalled on an unhandled native MCP elicitation request; an independent real app-server probe reproduced it. The stalled test was cancelled through the router API after confirming no inner process or repository changes, retaining outcome_unknown for inspected recovery. The existing user Herdr sessions were preserved.

Final source review found no remaining blocker. `npm run verify:ci` passed all 502 tests across 45 files; the separate integrated repair suite passed 336 tests. Build freshness, syntax, architecture and MCP mirror checks passed. The agent-spec boundaries passed while Node scenarios remain skipped and separately covered by Vitest.

The project-2 echo repair now preserves bridge-authenticated Matrix observation provenance and rechecks current membership before applying incoming member events. After restarting only the isolated backend/bridge, a fresh remove/add test held both Matrix and backend membership through 31 observations over 60 seconds; the member-event history showed no later kick (evidence 32 and 36). The initial failed convergence record is retained.

The Codex native MCP adapter now handles the observed elicitation protocol with exact active-item correlation, existing narrow coordination exceptions, owner approval for other supported calls and explicit failure for unknown/stale input. Twelve native adapter regressions and a real-model protocol probe passed. The original failed dispatch was formally inspected and continued as de95c608-4d2b-42b0-92d4-6f63d86d6b42. The retry's actual task read/comment/heartbeat calls succeeded; native command approval cards and one-time decisions traverse local Matrix. The test driver reviews concrete E2E commands under the operator's existing authorization, so this run is reported separately from Claude's observation-only execution. Owner-room representative membership and the Codex owner binding were explicitly prepared for this test, not credited as automatic provisioning.

Codex R1 subsequently reached the configured 20-minute wall-clock runner limit during native approvals and startup preparation. The task correctly became blocked/outcome_unknown. Inspection found a clean baseline repo, a ready dedicated lower with zero loops and an undispatched prepared nonce job; no implementation prompt, result or live monitor. The driver restarted only the idle E2E backend with HAFLEET_RUNNER_LEASE_MS=3600000, leaving source defaults, bridge, original Herdr sessions and native permissions intact, then formally continued the same task as dispatch 0474814b-63ba-4bbf-98ff-c47ae657d8a6 (nonce label E2EREPAIR20260906CODEX-R2). Evidence 54–56 preserves the failed R1 and recovery. This is operator recovery, not an autonomous-success claim for R1.

Final Codex R2 acceptance is verified (local Matrix API driven). Task task_9bf127e1-34fd-401a-8c15-4edf81394bd2 became done through the agent's scoped transition at 05:12:55.905Z; dispatch 0474814b-63ba-4bbf-98ff-c47ae657d8a6 separately completed. Exactly one matching final reply, $SLHElY98maZy9blIua7scY9gA9GMMmWm_MZDou2j3ts, reached original thread $8ArcXmH5MYMBG-TAhuiBdl_2ZNb3CFCScZNiNVkntRs. Real lower commit b1309f61acd23bd2595f5b3b6610f56a78e95057 passed 18 unit + 23 CLI integration tests and 26 additional middle-verifier CLI cases, plus fmt/clippy/build and scope/integrity checks. The middle naturally completed its owned monitor (fresh job a8b3f80a-61e7-4814-a7d8-c78d1fd37f5f), independently noticed and followed up the missing lower result, and corrected the lower's misreported test count using actual output. Driver did not implement, publish inner results, drive the monitor, or force business completion; it did perform documented formal recovery and native approvals. A separate clean verification clone also passed. Evidence 62, 68–74 contains artifacts, integrity hashes, lifecycle, delivery and runtime facts.

Final runtime check: all 26 one-time native approval decisions (14 in R1, 12 in R2) were consumed through local Matrix; no active router dispatch remained. Both Docker services are healthy and Palpo is bound to 127.0.0.1:8008. Project-2 membership remained correct after the later backend restart (evidence 64). All old Herdr sessions remain running. Global Claude settings and Codex config/hooks hashes are unchanged (evidence 44). Computer Use retry still failed with cgWindowNotFound (evidence 45), so fresh Robrix @ GUI acceptance remains unverified. Lower octoscode/kimi is the real tested execution backend; lower Claude/Codex/Grok combinations and the non-local continuity gate are not claimed. Source changes are reviewed and locally committed without push; final source commit and exact ACK are recorded in the external RESULT.md and .octos/OUTER_LOOP_REVIEW.md.


## 2026-09-06 Dashboard E2E repair

Operator added the HAFleet web dashboard to the same local E2E scope. Started the current Next console in mockup/ at 127.0.0.1:3100 against the isolated backend on 8090; the server-only proxy retains the API token. Computer Use in Chrome inspected resources/workforce, agent details/runtime/profile, capability/projects/engagements/usage/alerts/config/onboard. It reproduced false Config navigation and Profile save-success, a headless Codex marked tmux-missing, usage chart/card disagreement, and an untranslated probe state. An actual four-step preset creation persisted exact budget values (12345 total, 1234 daily), independently checked through the API.

Repairs add allowlisted on-demand runner readiness and durable dispatch activity without changing process online semantics, managed-workdir transcript attribution, consistent usage/task sets, working configuration form links, truthful readonly profile/runtime/oversight views, real probe refresh/timestamps and localized unusable state. Visible data now refreshes every 15 seconds and on focus/visibility return with concurrency/generation protection. Independent review additionally found that fixture agent details could delete a same-named real agent; all non-live action controls and the actual delete handler now reject that path, with an immediate in-flight guard.

Final Dashboard regressions: 53 tests / 6 files passed; production build, static invariants and ESLint passed. Backend related suite: 139 tests / 10 files passed plus an overlapping 22-test review check. npm run verify:ci passed its 502-test/45-file kernel; it does not replace the separately executed Dashboard selectors. agent-spec parse/lint/boundary checks ran; Node lifecycle scenarios remain skip and are not counted as passing. The console root package boundary needed ./package.json normalization; initial failed evidence is retained.

The final bundle is running on 3100. New same-origin API reads confirm Codex ready/idle with no active/queued/parked dispatches and no invented model, while the existing Claude tmux remains online. The test preset survived service restart and was then removed only after confirming no agent binding; e2e-fable remains. Both earlier accepted tasks stay done, project-2 memberships stay joined, both Docker services are healthy, and all original Herdr sessions remain running. No global mempal/Claude/Codex settings, original job processes or remote services were changed.

Fresh GUI acceptance of the final bundle is blocked: Chrome began returning cgWindowNotFound and read-only OS diagnostics confirmed the Mac was locked. Operator unlock was requested; the last retry still fails. Final click flows, visible automatic refresh and language/theme switching remain unverified, as does a new Robrix @ test. Initial successful GUI evidence and final HTTP/component checks are explicitly separate. Full screenshots, failures, tests, cleanup, local source commit and remaining acceptance work: ~/.octos/outer/verify/e2e-dashboard-20260906/RESULT.md.


## 2026-09-06 PR preparation and resumed Dashboard GUI

The operator authorized publishing the repairs as a PR. The Mac desktop became accessible again, allowing Computer Use to verify the final bundle's resources/workforce, matching task counts and 1k allocation charts, Codex on-demand runtime/Profile/Oversight, and the real Claude tmux pane. Config now opens both existing forms; Rescan updates the observed timestamp; Chinese unusable labels, light/dark/system themes and agent filtering work. Fixture agent action buttons and preset deletes are visibly disabled. A separately created, unbound local preset appears automatically in the resource list without manually reloading; cleanup targets that test record only. One remaining old stop-help text incorrectly promised supervisor restart and advised killing tmux for headless agents; it was corrected to state the unsupported operation without inventing a process.

Merged current origin/master (346cd8a, docs-only CI gating) and resolved its single adjacent CI conflict by applying the same code-change condition to root and dashboard dependency installation. The workflow's three tests passed. Independent review of 346cd8a..82b8712 found no evidenced credential leakage or Critical/Important blocker; thirty task-lifecycle/native-MCP/monitor tests passed independently. PR-preparation verify:ci first had one read ECONNRESET in api-runtime's Codex MCP test; the entire 24-test file then passed, followed by a complete 502-test/45-file verify:ci pass. Both outcomes are retained; no root-cause fix is claimed for the repository's documented intermittent socket-failure class. Evidence: ~/.octos/outer/verify/e2e-pr-20260906/.

The resumed Robrix GUI check also passed: selected e2e-codex through the actual @ member picker in project 2, inspected the complete composer before sending, and received exact E2EPR20260906GUIOK in the original thread. Matrix independently confirms the structured m.mentions target and one exact reply. The router automatically created probe task task_596aea36-3954-426e-8e96-ded362082c0e and it reached done; the driver did not force its status. This is a GUI transport/echo check, separate from the earlier real lower-work acceptance. Computer Use type_text dropped part of the draft and paste returned its clipboard timeout despite inserting the complete text; both were caught before sending. Final probe artifacts and screenshots are in e2e-pr-20260906/31–45.


## 2026-09-08 upstream integration closure

Resolved twenty HAFleet conflicts against origin/master4fb9749 in an isolated
worktree, preserving both native task lifecycle and Matrix/YOLO workflows. Fixed
the divergent migration-9 schema collision and retained SDK dependency isolation.
All279files/4151tests pass with one platform skip; final full-suite log is
/tmp/hafleet-integration-sharded-final.log. Four DM/startup regression files also
pass after the SDK injection adjustment. Build, syntax/lint, architecture, remote
package, CLI, dependency and447spec-binding checks pass, as do the webpack console
build and bilingual fixture browser workflows. Native agent-spec boundary passes;
its four Node scenarios remain Skip. Earlier fixture failures and the monolithic
OOM are preserved separately, with no automatic retries or skipped test files.

Robrix and Palpo upstream integrations were committed independently with native
validation. Only the separately requested Palpo web renewal/timeout repair was
deployed to Mini1; the broad HAFleet/Robrix/Palpo-Rust integration is not deployed.
No pushes or changes to the original concurrent website work. Root task-writer
is absent at this source checkout, so no canonical task completion was invented.
Review: docs/reviews/2026-09-08-upstream-integration.md.


## 2026-09-08 outbound implementation and no-tunnel acceptance

Implemented HAFleet durable outbound receive/publish and Palpo colocated Matrix relay, lease/ACK/sequence/generation checks, stored resource/status reads, automatic startup and import UI. HAFleet57d56da and Palpo9040bbcb were validated from isolated source trees before replacing the idle local services and pinned Mini1 containers. The minimal live Rust URL-CAS backport preserved existing authentication behavior and all registration identities. The original concurrent website checkout was untouched.

Real browser admin migration, owner download, HAFleet import and exact Mini1 Matrix proof passed. The owned SSH forwarding service and old bridge inbound listener were stopped. Repeated public browser/API checks and an independent Agent confirmed advancing heartbeat and three active usable verified requests. Old laptop18080 is retired; use https://crew.ominix.io:19444 and local HAFleet13202. Migration replays the old edision request as pending; no user request was auto-approved.

Post-cutover inspection found stale private-device endpoint caches. Follow-up4953baf validates and reuses original devices across the endpoint change. All fifty existing dispatches were complete before the coordinated bridge restart. All three live sessions changed only baseUrl and resumed sync with unchanged tokens/devices and no private startup warnings. No-tunnel browser acceptance passed again after that restart.

Validation: full HAFleet suite4174passed/oneplatformskip before the narrow device fix, followed by37passing tests across four exact direct-chat/outbound files. Palpo57Node and three browser suites passed; Linux minimal-backport CAS3 plus existing dynamic-auth1 passed. Production console, static checks, architecture and exact spec bindings passed. Native agent-spec cannot execute the seven Node lifecycle scenarios (Skip, not pass); the general console verifier retains three baseline invariant failures and one existing layout failure. No new native Robrix/model/file acceptance is claimed. Detailed evidence and recovery paths: docs/reviews/2026-09-08-palpo-outbound-implementation.md.


## 2026-09-08 shared thread context recovery

Reproduced why Edison could not see the operator's thread discussion with xiaobai: own Matrix replies were discarded by delivery dedup and direct-device own-message filtering before reaching the shared archive. Implemented adf3294 with79passing relevant tests and deployed only the bridge after existing user work finished. Retrieved actual shared-room history and repaired missing rows through the normal archive API, preserving source identity, promotion boundary and successful positions. Real read_conversation on a live-data copy included the recovered xiaobai answers for Edison. No Matrix message or model task was sent by verification. Native lifecycle12Node skips remain explicit. Report: docs/reviews/2026-09-08-shared-agent-thread-context.md.

## 2026-09-08 — Hagency website research and plan

Inspected the HAFleet source checkout, Robrix2 source checkout, Palpo source and
its separate web-admin worktree. Fetched the relevant public remote refs without
checking out or merging branches; read GitHub release metadata and public project
pages. Confirmed distinct local integration, public default-branch and released
states. Latest published releases observed: HAFleet1.2.0, Robrix/Robrix2 1.1.0,
Palpo0.4.0. Existing bilingual HAgency book and historical console/native imagery
are reusable only after naming, behavior and revision review.

Prepared docs/design/hagency-website-plan.md with positioning, audience paths,
16 core localized routes, project narratives, an eight-step demonstration,
visual direction, ten integrated guides, implementation architecture, maintenance
and measurable acceptance criteria. English/Chinese and developer-first audience
remain proposed defaults. Website implementation and publication were not started;
no application source, service, account or runtime profile was changed.

Research uses existing dated product-test reports, not a new application test run.
No executable website Task Contract is active: this artifact is an editorial
proposal; the independent website's implementation contract belongs to its next
stage. Agent-spec1.4 was inspected; an unretained draft's lint rejected manual
editorial scenarios without test selectors, so no lifecycle success is claimed
and no artificial test bindings were added. Root task-writer is absent; no
canonical task-state update was fabricated.

## 2026-09-08 — Adora website style and hero script review

The operator selected ymote/adora-website as the design reference and requested
inspection of its hero generation script. Local44ff68f matches remote HEAD.
Read dark/light generation scripts, Hero.astro, theme tokens, layout, theme
switcher and architecture section. Viewed both generated PNGs and captured
the deployed desktop hero in dark/light CSS states with an isolated headless
browser. Public page returned200. Screenshot captures are temporary review
artifacts under /tmp/hagency-adora-reference-{dark,light}.png.

The scripts use Google GenAI with gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview, separate prompts
and static PNG output. Their1920×1080 prose request is not an enforced API size;
both saved images are1376×768. Updated the Hagency proposal with the selected
charcoal/teal/amber design, HTML-over-generated-art hero, original collaboration
motif, a concrete generation brief, dark/light consistency and responsive image
checks. Product screenshots move below the hero. No image-generation request,
Adora source edit, website implementation or publication was performed.

## 2026-09-08 — Bilingual Hagency website implemented

The operator confirmed English and Chinese i18n. Created the independent Git
repository at projects/hagency-website (not a symlink). Implemented 29 routes per
language: 16 main pages, 10 guides, and 3 articles. Included all three project
narratives, eight-step illustrative workflow, search, theme/locale persistence,
verified download filters, documentation, security, roadmap, community, media,
localized metadata, RSS, sitemap, and 404. Generated original matching dark/light
hero art using the native image tool; prompts and outputs are documented in the
website's docs/artwork.md. This follows the reviewed Adora style.

Verified latest published releases through the GitHub API (11 binary/archive
assets), checked 16 source/documentation URLs (all HTTP 200), and retained the
distinction between published packages and local September 8 integration work.
No live product screenshots are invented; interface diagrams are labeled as
conceptual and the walkthrough explicitly uses illustrative data.

Validation from the edited website tree: Astro typecheck 0 errors/warnings/hints,
static build passes, all 8 Node/Playwright tests pass. Coverage includes 58 routes
and internal links/anchors, both locales, theme persistence, walkthrough/search/
downloads, all 16 main pages at 320/390/768px, and representative axe checks in
both themes. Native agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle boundary passes; six Node scenarios
remain native skips and its overall result remains non-passing. Independent Node
execution passes; see website docs/verification.md and lifecycle-result.json.

Static preview is running at http://127.0.0.1:4328/en/ and /zh-cn/, managed by
the website's Astro preview command. Original application source and services
were not modified. No public deployment, remote creation, commit, or push.
The root task-writer wrapper remains absent, so no canonical state was invented.

## 2026-09-08 — Matrix, federation, and agent-native positioning

The operator requested Matrix protocol education, its advantages over centralized
chat, open-source WeChat positioning, federation, and agents granted the same
privileges as humans. Added /en/matrix/ and /zh-cn/matrix/, a prominent homepage
section and hero copy, primary/footer navigation, and an expanded Matrix article.
The site now has 60 localized content pages. The new page explains clients,
homeservers and rooms, a five-row centralized/federated comparison, and explicit
room-role parity for human and agent identities. It distinguishes room grants
from runtime execution authority and explains relevant federation tradeoffs.

Added local-only interactive network and room-role illustrations. Actual Matrix
accounts, roles, servers and HAFleet runtime permissions were not changed. Six
primary Matrix source URLs returned HTTP 200. Typecheck/build pass; all ten Node
browser tests pass, including both new interactions, 60-route link validation,
17 main pages at 320/390/768px, and axe checks in both themes and languages.

Active website contract is specs/task-matrix-positioning.spec.md. Native
agent-spec1.4 boundary passes; four scenarios remain native skips because Node
is not executed, and the native overall result remains non-passing. Independent
browser evidence and lifecycle output are retained in the website docs. Local
preview remains on 127.0.0.1:4328; no public deployment, commit, or push.

## 2026-09-08 — Real project screenshot galleries

Added six genuine integration screenshots to the Hagency website: HAFleet
resources/engagements, Robrix2 native group/encrypted-room file collaboration,
and Palpo companion admin project access/resource catalog. Homepage previews
and two-image project galleries have English/Chinese descriptions, original
UI-language labels, and development-version context. Palpo's separate companion
app is explicitly distinguished from its server release. Original PNGs remain
byte-identical to their reviewed test captures; SHA-256 provenance and optimized
WebP previews are retained in the website tree. No live service was contacted
or changed for the captures.

The image viewer supports keyboard open/close and focus return, actual-size
scrolling, direct original links, no-JavaScript navigation, and localized load
errors. Typecheck and build pass. The complete browser suite passed 13/13;
after a final CSS-only catalog framing adjustment, all three screenshot tests
passed again (0 skips). Automated mobile checks cover 320/390/768px; visual
review covers both themes, both languages, desktop/mobile and long images.

Active contract: specs/task-project-screenshots.spec.md. Native agent-spec1.4
reports one boundary pass and five skips; its overall result remains non-passing
because it does not execute Node tests. Separate browser logs, lifecycle output,
and provenance are under the website docs. Preview is running at 127.0.0.1:4328.
No public deployment, commit, or push. The absent task-writer was not replaced.


## 2026-09-09 — Chinese Agent name validation repaired

Updated Palpo form/API and HAFleet protocol validation. Chinese display names
survive approval/provisioning fixtures while runtime/Matrix IDs remain ASCII.
67 Palpo and23 HAFleet tests pass, plus the Chinese-name Playwright fixture.
Deployed Mini1 web136171fcade9cd56 and restarted idle HAFleet backend/bridge.
Live 中文验证-0909 request reached HAFleet as pending without allocation.
Native agent-spec boundary passes;10 Node scenarios remain skipped.
Full evidence: docs/reviews/2026-09-09-unicode-agent-names.md. No commit/push.

## 2026-09-09 — Final-allocation Matrix Agent retirement

Implemented and deployed the operator's Edison retirement request: local runtime
stop and admission fencing, outbound fleet/request-scoped deactivation, zero-room
and denied-AS-authentication verification, durable retry and console feedback.
Other active allocations prevent whole-account retirement. Reconciled legacy
management aliases by exact MXID after real acceptance found one stale registered
row. Original revocation time and chat history remain intact.

Playwright invoked the deployed console action. Edison is now deactivated, has
zero joined rooms, fails AS authentication403 and AS discovery404; its
representative remains200 and four sibling identities remain active accounts.
All four sampled historical messages remain unchanged. 165 HAFleet tests and71
Palpo tests pass; production console build and468 spec bindings pass. Native
lifecycle boundary passes but four Node scenarios remain Skip (non-passing).
Unrelated usage502s remain recorded. Local backend7238/bridge7239/console7240;
Mini1 Web image177462cdd1d6be2d. Matrix Rust service unchanged. No commit/push or
fabricated canonical task transition. See
docs/reviews/2026-09-09-agent-matrix-retirement.md.

## 2026-09-09 — Account requests approved through Robrix

Implemented and deployed the requested Palpo Web signup → private administrator
room → native Robrix Approve/Reject → Matrix registration → ordinary-user login
flow in the isolated Palpo account-approval worktree. Real Mini1 approval created
a usable ordinary account; real rejection prevented login. The approved user
created a project and sent Agent request f3b7e3d6-49e1-4655-9da0-dfafd226e1fb,
which HAFleet received and left pending its owner's resource decision.

66 Node tests and four fixture browser scripts pass. Separate native evidence
records actual Matrix verdict events and post-restart receipt/login recovery.
Closed the first-use administrator history gap and stale project-readiness UI.
The earlier web release required forced shutdown and left a stale lock; recovered
only after confirming its owner stopped, then bounded shutdown and tested worker
I/O cancellation. Later upgrade exited0 and kept both request decisions.

Final web image: palpo-web-admin:cc23a8c98efb31c9. HAFleet runtime, Matrix Rust
binary and operator Robrix desktop profile were preserved. Source changes are
uncommitted in feat/account-approval-20260909; no push/merge was performed for
this batch. The source checkout still has no provisioned task-writer, so no
canonical task-state transition was fabricated.


## 2026-09-09 — Investigate approved ymote login failure

Verified actual administrator verdict and successful registration of @ymote at
2026-09-09T16:31:14Z. Matrix reports an active ordinary account, unlocked and
not deactivated; the pending encrypted password was removed after registration.
Observed two HTTP403 login attempts, followed by HTTP429 even for login
discovery. Adjusted only the live Matrix login rate configuration (burst20,
refill0.1/sec), backed it up and restarted the homeserver. Six consecutive
public login discovery checks returned200, an existing approved ordinary test
account authenticated successfully, and the account approval worker is ready.
No password reset, account recreation, Matrix source edit, commit or push.
The operator was asked for the exact remaining error and to retry with the
password chosen for ymote; that user's password has not been independently
verified.

## 2026-09-09 — Account and Agent workflow integration

Committed the HAFleet changes as1e2d279 and Palpo Web as3d63ae11; the latter is
now on local main. Integrated HAFleet with local master in an isolated worktree,
retaining both sides of two additive documentation conflicts and preserving
the primary workspace's unrelated website edits separately. CI exposed an
extracted-handler visibility issue and a separate outbound inbox ownership gap;
the explicit local guard and exact adapter-owner rule now pass, with negative
coverage retaining the router internal-import restriction.

Final CI:505 kernel/CLI tests and470 spec bindings pass. Related regression190,
new boundary1 and Palpo71 tests pass; all four Palpo browser scripts pass. Counts
overlap. Native lifecycle remains non-passing with two Node skips; optional live
CI probes skipped without a runtime. No live changes or push. Palpo upstream
Rust commit62fa8566 remains outside this local Web merge. Full evidence and
restoration notes: docs/reviews/2026-09-09-account-agent-lifecycle-merge.md.

## 2026-09-09 — Close the c380959/f89c746 review findings

Retraced the supplied review against merged master 8dfea48 and repaired the
remaining findings in fix/review-closure-20260909. Direct commands use their
Agent device and cannot wedge sync on a failed reply; retired mentions no longer
defer admission. Host-owned session provenance prevents private replies, files
and activity from entering promoted group rooms. Explicit unreachable-side
abandonment now uses the structured cleanup result and retains remote failures.

Admission floors and bounded history windows limit context work. Historical
attachments download only on authorized receive_file calls. Grant responses
exclude internal approval metadata; null-Agent owner resolution requires room
agreement. Approval rollback/retention, permanent notice settlement, schema
migrations, runtime spawn ownership and the remaining portability/UI findings
are covered by targeted regressions. Earlier merged fixes for SDK isolation,
the five original tests and catalog withdrawal remain intact.

Final full suite: 4,226 passed, zero failed, one platform skip in 286 files.
CI passes with 479 spec bindings and 505 overlapping kernel/CLI tests. Console
Webpack build and English/Chinese Playwright permission flows pass. Default
Turbopack cannot follow the isolated worktree's external dependency symlink.
Native agent-spec has one boundary pass and nine skipped Node scenarios, so its
overall result remains non-passing. Optional live probes skipped; no live
deployment or Matrix/LLM acceptance is claimed. Findings, evidence and limits:
docs/reviews/2026-09-09-review-followup.md. The source task-writer is absent.

## 2026-09-09 — Merge conflict-free dependency PR 157

Merged HAFleet PR 157 into the isolated review integration; GitHub confirms
MERGED at 7f61fcd. Fresh root/console npm installs, the actual registry advisory
ratchet and 22 focused tests pass. Full verify:ci passes with 483 executable
spec bindings and 505 kernel/CLI tests. The new inventory rejected the PR
manual-test placeholder; its mandatory registry check now lives explicitly in
Constraints, while all four real offline test bindings remain intact. Native
agent-spec records one boundary pass and four Node skips, not lifecycle success.

HAFleet PRs 154/155/156/158 conflict with local master and remain unmerged.
The current account has only READ permission on palpo-im/palpo, so its upstream
PRs cannot be merged here. No live deployment changed. Website coordination
edits remain outside the integration. Full details and evidence locations:
docs/reviews/2026-09-09-pr157-integration.md.

## 2026-09-09 — Resolve four open HAFleet PR conflicts

Integrated PRs 154/155/156/158 into an isolated branch from 212de5f. Preserved
loopback custody, runner activity and cleanup proof, private execution policy,
legacy terminal observation, reusable approval authority and representative
identity. PR 156 integration regressions were reproduced before repair. All
focused batches pass: 88, 34, 97 and 191 tests (overlapping coverage). Final
suite: 4,268 pass, one platform skip in 290 passing files. CI passes with 508
kernel/CLI tests and 523 specification bindings. Console production build and
English/Chinese Playwright permissions and hybrid runtime checks pass. Native
Node lifecycle skips remain non-passing; actual Vitest results are separate.

All four PRs merged on GitHub; master is 0ab52fe and there are no open HAFleet
PRs. Their merge receipts joined the local integration at f8c82c4 without
changing the verified tree. Local review/workflow history and conflict fixes
remain unpublished. Website coordination edits are preserved separately;
no live service changed. Details: docs/reviews/2026-09-09-open-pr-integration.md.

## 2026-09-09 — Console debugging-text cleanup

- Implemented concise bilingual presentation and closed diagnostic details across
  the provider console on `fix/console-product-copy`. Status, sample/unavailable
  data, execution permissions and budget limitations remain explicit.
- Fixed the Resources toast-hook mismatch and a null provider label found during
  visual inspection. 84 Vitest tests and 16 controlled browser cases passed; the
  production build passed. Legacy invariant failures remain identical to the
  baseline; native agent-spec lifecycle has four unsupported, non-passing skips.
- Replaced only the local web UI at port13202 with the verified build. Backend
  PID7238/port18194 and Agent/Matrix processes remain running. Six live pages and
  both deployed UI languages were checked read-only. No live requests were approved.
- Source is not committed. Prior documentation edits were preserved. See
  [review and deployment evidence](reviews/2026-09-09-console-product-presentation.md).
- Final deployment check exposed an intermittent usage timeout against the
  unchanged 8-second proxy limit. Resource data remains live; the page labels
  usage unavailable. This was not counted as successful live usage verification.

## 2026-09-09 — Start native migration in an isolated worktree

- Created `feat/rust-migration` from merged `5dbef22` in a separate worktree.
  Copied only the migration draft, requirement and review from the original dirty
  checkout. The original checkout and running deployments remain independent.
- Revised the Node-only project contract, added REQ-RUST-MIGRATION-EXECUTION and
  a bounded Cargo task contract. Implemented native Salvo HTTP/CLI, private state,
  exclusive custody ownership, schema checks, atomic content-bound receipts,
  bounded queues/storage, explicit overload and drained shutdown.
- Added native subprocess crash/restart tests with PATH empty, JavaScript golden
  vectors, and a fresh encrypted Matrix SDK restart proof with strict cross-signing.
  M0 discovery records112 entry/helper candidates and201 literal routes. ADR-028
  documents exact future domain commit boundaries and remaining release gates.
- This checkpoint does not implement project/resource allocation, Agent execution,
  connected Matrix/Palpo transport or console parity. No production cutover,
  live credentials, canonical runtime task update or deployment is claimed.
- Local verification:13 Rust tests passed, two Vitest spec-binding tests passed,
  rustfmt/Clippy/ESLint passed, and the Cargo-backed agent-spec lifecycle passed
  all8 scenarios plus the explicit boundary check (9/9, no skips). Windows GNU
  cross-compilation/Clippy of the native app/store/tests passed; native OS CI
  is still required. Production listeners remain PID46398/13202 and PID7238/18194.

- M2 started: ported the selected-resource/shared-seat projection with29 golden
  vectors from the current JS function. Added JSON-safe token values, checked
  accumulation and missing/null period distinction. The native API still cannot
  allocate or provision Agents. All15 local Rust tests pass; the allocation task
  lifecycle passes2 scenarios plus its boundary check. Native CI for080cf90 passed
  on Linux and macOS; Windows stopped at CRLF-converted golden JSON. Added explicit
  LF attributes for those byte fixtures before rerunning native Windows checks.

## 2026-09-10 — Native selected-resource domain checkpoint

- Continued the full migration goal in `feat/rust-migration`; preserved the
  original checkout and live services. Prior checkpoint47d217a passed native
  Windows/Linux/macOS CI and existing Node CI (4,280 passed, one platform skip).
- Added one domain SQLite writer for project binding/evidence, immutable intake,
  selected-pool/shared-seat reservation, decision replay and effect intents. Native
  admission verifies full source/room/owner observations and cannot deserialize
  HTTP-provided approval flags. Runtime and Matrix adapters remain unimplemented.
- Added38 JS-produced Unicode/public/runtime identity vectors. Added concurrent
  reservation and injected-commit-failure coverage, uncertain effect recovery,
  generation/project remapping fences and explicit retirement retry. Resource
  configuration/publication APIs now preserve withdrawal on ordinary edits and
  retain operator access to withdrawn configurations.
- Local checks:22 Cargo tests passed, rustfmt/Clippy and three golden vector
  generators passed. Native bindings have17 selectors and zero missing tests;
  the new agent-spec lifecycle passed all6 scenarios plus its boundary check.
  Windows GNU cross-Clippy passed earlier in this checkpoint; native OS CI must
  still validate the final committed changes. See the checkpoint review for
  remaining M2 scope and M3–M9 gates. Full migration remains active.
- The existing documentation scan initially consumed extensionless Cargo binaries
  under `target/` and failed at Node's maximum string length. Added Cargo output
  exclusion plus a fixture proving ordinary extensionless scripts remain scanned.
  The documentation and Node spec-binding checks now pass all9 tests. No runtime
  behavior or assertion was bypassed to hide this migration/build interaction.

## 2026-09-10 — Native model qualification checkpoint

- Embedded the existing role-capacity policy without changing its model table.
  Native model/provider/reasoning qualification matches 99 JavaScript profile
  cases and 18 resource ordering cases. Catalog roles are derived; supplied role
  grants are rejected. Explicit withdrawal persists, and review qualification
  counts only active model families on the requesting registration.
- Admission and first reservation recheck current qualification while exact
  replays and already reserved effect identities remain recoverable. Native
  domain schema 2 uses ordered transactional migration files; injected failures,
  old cached roles, repeated startup and downgrade rejection are covered.
- Local validation: 25 Cargo tests passed with no failures or ignored tests;
  rustfmt, Clippy, qualification golden check and generator ESLint passed.
  Native spec bindings resolve all 20 selectors. The qualification lifecycle
  passed all 3 scenarios plus the boundary check, with no skip or uncertainty.
- Prior commit 5c08ad9 passed Linux/macOS/Windows native CI and Node CI
  (4,281 passed, one platform skip). That CI result does not validate this
  checkpoint until its own committed head runs. Full M0–M9 migration remains
  active; task/dispatch authority and recovery are the next bounded implementation.

## 2026-09-10 — Native canonical task and dispatch kernel

- Committed qualification checkpoint f7a2c89 passed native Linux/macOS/Windows
  CI (run 34459254680) and existing Node CI (run 34459254681).
- Added domain schema 3 for tasks, sessions, dispatch attempts, resource leases,
  content-bound mutation receipts and task events. Current started capabilities
  are required for task writes; coordinator reads remain scoped to its session.
  Comments use the host-owned Agent name, heartbeat uses the host clock, and
  explicit completion advances the task authorization epoch. Missing wait patches
  retain metadata; explicit null clears it. Runtime completion cannot finish tasks.
- Dispatch payloads freeze before launch. Parked work retains resources. Expired
  or restarted unstarted work can requeue; started work becomes unknown, with
  session/workspace quarantine and authenticated rejected-output audit. Inspected
  recovery creates a distinct dispatch and supersedes old queued instructions.
- Local validation: all 30 native tests passed; subsequent final test-only expiry
  additions passed their bound lifecycle scenario. The task lifecycle passed all
  5 scenarios plus its boundary check, with zero failures/skips/uncertainty.
  Clippy, rustfmt and the JS transition golden/ESLint checks passed. Shared vectors
  cover every 25-pair canonical task transition; 25 native spec selectors resolve.
- No real runner, Matrix ingress or live deployment was changed. Host-only session
  admission/inspection still requires the M4/M5 adapters. Next: mailbox and group
  ordering/deduplication, graph/delegation, follow-up and durable reply delivery.
  Full migration goal remains active; the draft PR is not a cutover candidate.

## 2026-09-10 — Native message admission and frozen input

- Previous commit 66168f4 passed native Linux/macOS/Windows CI (34460927082) and
  existing Node CI (34460927153). Its task/dispatch changes are verified at that head.
- Added schema 4 canonical session uniqueness, immutable event identity and
  independent per-session input projections. Committed arrival sequence preserves
  total order even with equal or reversed source timestamps. Bounded/filtered
  inbox reads leave unseen work pending.
- Dispatch enqueue freezes and claims admitted input atomically. Only a wake can
  start ordinary work, and runner inbox reads are restricted to the current frozen
  batch. Completing one Agent's dispatch preserves another Agent's copy. Unknown
  work transfers input only through inspected recovery; superseded unstarted input
  returns to the pending inbox and quarantine still accepts new messages.
- Validation: 34 native tests passed, zero failed/ignored. Message lifecycle passed
  four scenarios plus boundary, zero skips/uncertainty. Native spec catalog has 29
  selectors, none missing. Clippy and rustfmt passed. Injected admission/input/
  settlement failures roll back; oversized input remains pending; conflicting old
  session bindings roll back the schema upgrade. A compiler assertion prevents
  adding DeserializeOwned to the trusted ingress command.
- Real Matrix authentication, room privacy/history and mention policy remain M5;
  native ingress has no public HTTP constructor. Next implement narrow runner APIs,
  task input activation/follow-up, dependency/delegation and reply delivery. The
  complete migration remains active and production services remain unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 — Native scoped runner service API

- Message/input commit 22fc509 passed native three-OS CI (34462648100) and existing
  Node CI (34462648110). Continued the full migration goal in the same worktree.
- Added a narrow private runner API for tasks, comments, typed mutations and frozen
  input pages. Current runner headers authorize this surface separately from
  operator resource management; browser/proxy, duplicated and URL credentials fail.
  Unknown actions, caller clock/identity fields and oversized bodies are rejected.
- RunnerCommand now obtains its clock inside the bounded domain writer. A request
  that entered with valid credentials is rejected if its lease expires while queued.
  Each final operation also rechecks parked/revoked/current task authority. Canonical
  completion still requires an explicit transition and advances the task epoch.
- Validation: 38 native tests passed, zero failed/ignored; four new scenarios plus
  lifecycle boundary passed with no skip/uncertainty. All 33 native spec selectors
  resolve. Clippy and rustfmt passed. HTTP tests exercise the real Salvo handlers
  with in-process requests and fixture allocations; they do not prove live runtime
  or homeserver integration. The queue-time authority test exercises the actual
  dedicated writer and expires its queued capability before releasing that writer.
- Next: task metadata/input activation, graph/delegation, authenticated follow-up,
  durable reply delivery and real runtime/platform ownership. Full migration remains
  active. Native execution is still unavailable and production services are intact.

## 2026-09-10 — Native task activation, delegation and human follow-up

- Previous runner API commit 99aaac6 passed native three-OS CI (34464031294)
  and Node CI (34464031312). Continued the full migration in the isolated worktree.
- Added schema 5: task metadata, task/source binding, idempotent attachment receipts
  and a fenced notice outbox share domain.sqlite3. Failed notice or input writes
  roll back the complete intent/activation transaction. Receipts bind exact server,
  room and stable Matrix transaction ID; restart preserves claims until expiration.
  Revoked allocations cannot activate, and permanent send failure requires retry.
- Runner POST /delegations goes through the bounded writer and its execution-time
  clock. Only the current started creator can delegate admitted source input within
  the project; an explicit parent must be its bound task. Child progress and input
  acknowledgement remain independent from the parent. Forged owner/delivery fields
  are rejected by the actual Salvo endpoint.
- Human follow-up keeps the original task done during enqueue and claim. Actual
  start rechecks attached, unprocessed original-sender thread input, new receipt/
  origin time and current dispatch authority, then changes the epoch and commits
  a continuation notice. Non-message peer traffic, another sender and stale input
  do not reopen tasks. Taskless dispatches cannot bypass an intent's activation.
- Validation: all 43 native tests passed, zero failed/ignored. Five specification
  scenarios plus the lifecycle boundary passed without skip/uncertainty; all 38
  native spec selectors resolve. Clippy, rustfmt and diff checks passed. Coverage
  includes rollback, restart/retry, delegation, follow-up and private HTTP authority.
- This is an internal task orchestration implementation, not a live transport or
  runner claim. Graph scheduling, final replies, group/MCP interfaces, real Matrix
  provenance/privacy and M4–M9 remain open. No live deployment was changed.

## 2026-09-10 — Native task graph planning policy

- Task-intent commit 5e68a06 passed Windows/macOS/Linux native CI (34467398049);
  Node CI (34467398054) also passed. No live service was changed.
- Added a bounded pure graph planner with deterministic dependency failure,
  cancellation, skip and readiness transitions. Fractional results remain JSON
  values. Missing/null comparison and primitive truthiness match the existing
  JavaScript policy; inherited functions are inert values only. String property
  traversal remains refused, as required by the actual legacy getNestedValue.
- The unchanged JavaScript implementation generates 156 condition and ten graph
  transition vectors. Native CI now checks fixture freshness. The initial vector
  run caught a string-property mismatch, which was corrected against the source;
  all vectors now pass. Definitions reject missing/duplicate nodes, dependency and
  condition cycles; results and nesting are bounded. Runtime definitions cannot
  assert an owner or completed node status.
- Validation: all 46 native tests passed, zero failed/ignored; Clippy, rustfmt and
  fixture checks passed. Three graph scenarios plus lifecycle boundary passed
  without skip/uncertainty; all 41 native specification selectors resolve.
- This is a pure planning step. Durable graph storage, authenticated canonical-task
  observations, internal/local session routes and mailbox/group delivery still need
  integration. Proposed dispatch status is never evidence of actual task execution.
  The full M0–M9 migration remains active.

## 2026-09-10 — Structured numeric runner payloads

- Graph-policy commit a818f0f passed native three-OS CI (34468571499); its Node
  CI (34468571496) is still running. The migration continues in the isolated tree.
- Removed the integer-only restriction from execution data while preserving it for
  signed authority DTOs. Queued input now stores and hashes the same canonical
  representation. Finite numbers follow existing JavaScript double semantics;
  exact identity/count/generation fields keep their typed authority validation.
- Used the Rust ecosystem integration skill to inspect pinned ryu-js 1.0.3, its
  safe finite formatting API, license and minimum Rust version. Enabled JSON float
  round-trip parsing. No authority endpoint or policy was broadened.
- The unchanged JS canonicalizer generates 271 numeric vectors, including exponent
  boundaries, subnormals, negative zero, very large values and deterministic double
  bit patterns. Those exposed why exact-integer-literal rejection is incompatible
  with JS shortest formatting; the final data contract uses JS Number semantics.
- All 48 native tests passed, zero failed/ignored. Numeric dispatch replay and
  conflicting content were verified across repository restart. Both scenarios and
  the lifecycle boundary passed with no skip/uncertainty; all 43 native selectors
  resolve. Clippy, rustfmt and fixture checks passed. The initial boundary check
  required explicit ./ prefixes for root Cargo paths; the corrected exact scope
  passed without broadening the intended changes.
- Internal session/group/mailbox routes and graph-to-canonical-task integration
  remain next. Real process/transport, console and cutover work remain open.

## 2026-09-10 — Internal conversation session ownership

- Numeric payload commit bcd028e passed native three-OS CI (34469526457) and Node
  CI (34469526454). Graph-policy Node CI (34468571496) also passed.
- Schema 6 adds explicit internal routes under the existing task/dispatch owner,
  without fake Matrix rooms. Matrix and internal wire variants reject mixed or
  unknown fields. Canonical route uniqueness and old-schema migration tests remain.
- Conversation creation requires a current started creator, active participants
  from the same project/generation, and an idempotent content-bound call ID. Its
  conversation row and all participant session/membership rows commit atomically.
  The private API obtains authority time inside the bounded domain writer.
- Reads allow the exact creator session or the internal session belonging to that
  conversation. Another Matrix session of the same Agent is denied. Revoked
  participants lose current capability access. Matrix ingress and inbox reads
  explicitly refuse internal routes. Completed tasks cannot create conversations.
- Tests cover injected write rollback, replay/conflict, foreign/parked/expired and
  revoked callers, independent tasks for one Agent in two conversations, and
  unknown-attempt recovery across restart. An initial recovery test reused the old
  payload and was correctly refused; the test now asserts that refusal and submits
  a distinct inspected recovery instruction without weakening the guard.
- All 53 native tests passed, zero failed/ignored. Five internal-session scenarios
  plus lifecycle boundary passed without skip/uncertainty; all 48 native selectors
  resolve. Clippy, rustfmt and diff checks passed. No live service changed.
- Peer mailbox and group lifecycle, atomic graph/message/task linkage, standalone
  local Agents and the remaining M4–M9 work remain open. Conversation admission
  alone is not peer delivery, model execution or complete migration parity.

## 2026-09-10 — Scoped native peer input delivery

- Internal-session commit b5373b2 passed native Windows/macOS/Linux CI (34470955482)
  and Node CI (34470955561).
- Schema 7 commits a content-bound peer receipt and every recipient projection
  atomically. Sources come from the current started capability. Recipients are
  exact conversation sessions, including the original creator's Matrix session.
  Arbitrary rooms belonging to the same Agent cannot send or receive this traffic.
- Request and response messages can wake incomplete work; notification messages
  remain context. Pages are bounded and do not acknowledge input. Dispatch enqueue
  freezes input, completion acknowledges only its recipient copy, and inspected
  recovery transfers uncertain input while releasing superseded queued arrivals.
- Matrix activation still needs the original admitted input; peer replies cannot
  reopen completed tasks. Current membership is checked at send, enqueue and start,
  with closed-conversation work filtered before lease. Runtime authority also now
  rechecks task binding, including processes started before a new pending intent.
  Separate host-only unstarted cleanup remains available after binding changes.
- All 58 native tests passed, zero failed/ignored. Five peer scenarios and lifecycle
  boundary passed without skip/uncertainty; all 53 native selectors resolve.
  Clippy, rustfmt and diff checks passed. Tests include injected admission/claim/ACK
  rollback, stale/revoked/parked callers, finite data, retry conflicts, separate
  recipient custody, new arrivals across restart and actual protected Salvo routes.
- No models or live homeservers were contacted. Group lifecycle, atomic graph/task
  linkage, final delivery and M4–M9 remain open. An existing completed Matrix task
  cannot yet use a taskless inspected recovery report because the intent binding
  guard refuses it; a durable scoped report exception is the next correction.

## 2026-09-10 — Completed task report recovery

- Peer-mailbox commit 17246a0 passed native Windows/macOS/Linux CI (34474218701).
  Its Node CI (34474218712) was still running at this checkpoint.
- Schema 8 closes the completed Matrix intent recovery gap. A host-inspected
  taskless replacement receives a durable grant for the exact completed task and
  epoch, committed with recovery history and both input transfers. Grant failure
  rolls back replacement, quarantine clearing and input assignment together.
- Runtime authority distinguishes reporting from creating work. A report may read
  its completed task and frozen input, but cannot reopen it, read unrelated child
  tasks, delegate, create groups/tasks or send peer requests. Revoked allocations
  and changed task epochs invalidate report authority at current dispatch gates.
- Consecutive report interruptions remain recoverable after separate host
  inspection. Fresh human input remains pending independently; a new human turn
  invalidates old reports even after that new turn completes. Historical native
  report migration requires the original attempt's persisted done receipt.
- Distinct recovery instruction comparison now uses canonical finite-number JSON,
  preventing 1 versus 1.0 from bypassing the different-payload requirement.
- All 61 native tests passed, zero failed/ignored. Three report scenarios plus the
  lifecycle boundary passed without skip/uncertainty; all 56 native selectors
  resolve. Clippy, rustfmt and diff checks passed. An initial fixture used incorrect
  attachment argument order; the fixture was corrected and full validation rerun.
- This grants neither filesystem access nor external delivery authority. Real
  process stop/ownership proof, group lifecycle, graph/task linkage, final output,
  transport, console and cutover gates remain open. Live services are unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 — Initial native process scope proof

- Recovery-report commit c043ea1 passed native three-OS CI (34475309134) and Node
  CI (34475309167). Peer commit 17246a0 Node CI (34474218712) also passed.
- Added the separate hagency-platform library and native probe binary. Its host
  launch DTO has explicit absolute executable/cwd, bounded argument/environment
  data and no inherited environment or shell wrapper. Existing locked rustix and
  windows-sys dependencies are reused; no dependency versions changed.
- Windows JOB_LIST establishes kill-on-close Job Object ownership inside process
  creation. Microsoft documents a crash window in suspended-then-assign startup;
  this implementation avoids that window. Cancellation uses owned handles and
  reports whole-tree stop only after zero active job processes and leader exit.
- POSIX establishes a process group before exec and holds the unreaped leader until
  final signals. Early-exit and repeated-stop tests preserve cancellation authority
  without signalling a reaped PID again. Group cancellation does not claim detached
  child or owner-crash containment; required crash guarantees refuse before spawn.
- ADR-029 records the API guarantee, exclusive host child-reaper requirement and
  separation from sandbox permission. Probe tests cover grandchildren, early exit,
  Drop cleanup, Unicode/quote/backslash/literal shell characters, explicit env,
  invalid/missing executable, embedded NUL and unrelated-process isolation.
- All 64 native tests passed locally on macOS, zero failed/ignored. Three scoped
  scenarios plus boundary passed; 59 native selectors resolve. Workspace Clippy,
  rustfmt and diff checks passed. Windows all-target Clippy cross-compilation also
  passed. Windows actual owner-crash Job Object execution remains a CI gate for
  this commit; the POSIX scenario proves refusal, not unimplemented containment.
- Agent execution remains disabled. POSIX guardian and detached-descendant identity,
  actual sandbox/runner IO, M3 graph/group/final delivery and M5–M9 remain open.
  No live deployment or model was contacted.

## 2026-09-10 — Kernel-bound child signal identities

- Process-scope commit e78f274 passed native CI on all three OS families
  (34476712504), including the actual Windows owner-exit Job Object test. Its
  Node run (34476712391) was still running when this step began.
- Added opaque child signal authority constructed only from a host-owned Child.
  Its read-only PID/birth metadata cannot create authority or retarget the handle.
  Linux retains pidfds, Windows duplicates existing process handles, and macOS
  checks unique process lifetime plus kernel-checked audit PID versions.
- Local SDK/source inspection found macOS proc_signal_with_audittoken. A harmless
  SIGCONT probe accepted the current version and rejected a changed version with
  ESRCH; signal zero was rejected with EINVAL and was not treated as a pass. Rust
  tests now preserve that real kernel check. An exec fixture confirms lifetime
  continuity while audit versions can be refreshed before a guarded signal.
- Tests terminate controlled children while unrelated children keep writing,
  retain expired handles after reaping, reject mismatched metadata and exercise
  in-place Unix exec. They do not force numeric PID recycling or prove descendant
  discovery. Existing process-scope tests remain unchanged and pass.
- All 68 native tests passed locally on macOS, zero failed/ignored, including one
  macOS-only kernel test. Three child-identity scenarios plus boundary passed;
  62 native selectors resolve. Workspace Clippy, rustfmt and diff checks passed;
  Windows all-target Clippy cross-compilation passed. New Linux/Windows runtime
  checks remain CI gates for this commit.
- Native guardian handoff, complete descendant discovery, runner IO and effective
  sandbox integration remain next. No model or live service was contacted; the
  platform primitives are not yet connected to Agent dispatch.

## 2026-09-10 — Native guardian startup and owner-loss cleanup

- Child-identity commit 2f44bd9 passed native three-OS CI (34479002630) and
  Node CI (34479002645). Its predecessor e78f274 also passed both pipelines.
- Added a native guardian entrypoint and shared SupervisedProcess API. Unix uses
  an anonymous socket with separate Prepare and Start messages, bounded frames,
  absolute partial-frame deadlines and explicit launch environment. Windows
  retains direct atomic Job Object ownership without an unnecessary helper.
- Owner EOF, malformed control input and leader exit now cancel the owned scope.
  Guardian startup failure launches no fallback. A host timeout closes its channel
  and preserves independent guardian cleanup; it does not kill the guardian and
  infer descendant stop. POSIX reports still refuse full cleanup guarantees.
- Auditing found that a plain dup would leak the reply endpoint into work. The
  implementation now duplicates it with CLOEXEC; real fixtures verify that no
  socket descriptor reaches the work process. No runtime secrets are printed.
- The actual hagency CLI integration test found macOS group signalling returning
  EPERM for a zombie-only group. A standalone native reproduction and XNU source
  confirmed the behavior. Stop now attempts both group and owned-child signals,
  reaps the leader and retains signal failure in signals_accepted. It never treats
  EPERM as evidence that a group is empty or complete descendant cleanup succeeded.
- All 73 native tests passed locally on macOS, zero failed/ignored. Four guardian
  scenarios plus the boundary passed; 67 native selectors resolve with none
  missing. Workspace Clippy/rustfmt, Windows all-target Clippy cross-compilation
  and diff checks passed. Actual new Linux/Windows behavior remains a CI gate.
- Tests exercise controller exit without Drop, grandchildren, early leader exit,
  unrelated-process survival, repeated stop, Unicode/literal argv, uncommitted
  startup, oversized and partial frames, active protocol failure and the actual
  native CLI. No model, deployed store or live service was contacted.
- Complete detached-descendant discovery, guardian-loss recovery, bounded runner
  IO, effective sandbox/approval adapters and M3/M5–M9 parity remain open. Agent
  execution remains disabled; this checkpoint does not complete the migration.

## 2026-09-10 — Close the guardian CI descriptor leak

- Guardian commit 5678697 passed Ubuntu and Windows native CI but failed macOS
  native CI (34481110874). The existing zero-inherited-sockets assertion found
  two extra descriptors from the embedding CI host. This failure was not waived.
- Added a controlled parent socket pair with CLOEXEC explicitly cleared. It
  reproduced the same two-socket failure locally before the fix. Both guardian
  and work startup now seal every descriptor above stderr in the post-fork child.
  The original strict assertion passes, and parent descriptor flags stay intact.
- Linux uses direct close_range(CLOEXEC), requiring kernel 5.11+. macOS uses its
  actual post-fork descriptor table and fcntl with fixed stack storage, refusing
  truncated observations before exec. Only direct syscalls run in the callback.
  The existing locked libc supplies its ABI; no dependency version changed.
- Descriptors are marked CLOEXEC rather than closed immediately, so Rust can
  still deliver exec failures through its internal pipe. Existing missing-binary
  and invalid-startup tests continue to pass. Windows handle inheritance remains
  disabled by its native CreateProcess path.
- All 73 native tests passed locally with the reproducer enabled, zero failed or
  ignored; workspace Clippy and rustfmt passed. Linux and Windows all-target
  Clippy cross-compilation passed. Four guardian scenarios plus boundary passed
  again. The corrected OS CI remains a gate; no deployed service changed.

## 2026-09-10 — Linux detached-descendant custody

- Descriptor-sealing commit df52fd3 passed Ubuntu/Windows native CI and the strict
  socket check on macOS. macOS then failed the unrelated-progress assertion that
  assumed a write within exactly 80 ms. The test now checks native process liveness
  while requiring fresh writes within a bounded deadline; death or stalled work
  still fails. Run 34482313701 therefore remains failed, not waived or green.
- Added Linux guardian subreaper custody before workload startup. The guardian
  must be single-threaded with no pre-existing children, restores normal SIGCHLD
  disposition, and verifies pidfd wait support before admitting work. Native CLI
  guardian mode now runs before constructing Tokio.
- Discovery is a bounded prefix of the kernel child list. Each candidate requires
  P_PIDFD waitability before a pidfd signal; stale or unrelated candidates supply
  no signal authority. The root retains its exclusive std Child reaper. Only a
  reaped root plus kernel ECHILD with __WALL can establish full observed cleanup;
  empty/truncated discovery is never sufficient. Timeout/errors remain unknown.
- Added native detached-session/double-fork fixtures for cancellation, controller
  exit without Drop and early root exit. Windows uses its existing Job Object
  path. macOS refuses the unsupported custody requirement before starting these
  fixtures; it does not claim detached-descendant cleanup.
- All 76 native tests passed locally on macOS, zero failed/ignored; three new
  descendant selectors prove the explicit macOS refusal. Linux and Windows
  all-target Clippy cross-compilation passed. The three bound scenarios plus
  boundary passed, and all 70 native selectors resolve. Actual Linux/Windows
  descendant execution remains a required CI gate for this implementation.
- Workspace Clippy/rustfmt and diff checks passed. The guardian suite passed again
  after strengthening its liveness observation. Guardian-death recovery, complete
  macOS custody, actual runner/sandbox adapters and the remaining migration phases
  are still open. Full requested POSIX crash containment continues to refuse;
  observed successful cleanup is distinct from a promise that every cleanup will
  succeed. No deployed service, credential or live model was touched.

## 2026-09-10 — Native internal conversation lifecycle

- Previous head a737b83 passed Native Rust CI 34483826435 on all three operating
  systems and Node CI 34483826386. This includes real Linux/Windows detached
  descendants and the corrected macOS liveness observation; earlier failed runs
  remain recorded as failures.
- Implemented schema 9: creator-scoped member replacement and closure with
  expected revisions and content-bound replay receipts. Same-project/current
  allocation checks remain required, and rejoining creates a new internal SID.
  Retired sessions, tasks and immutable messages remain available for inspection.
- Closure fences affected dispatches and recursively closes child conversations
  created by retired sessions. Queued/unstarted work is superseded; started,
  parked and unknown work retains resource custody and durable host stop intents.
  Stop intents survive restart and count against the scheduler's concurrency cap.
- Host inspection settlement is fenced, idempotent and transactional. It cannot
  clear another unresolved attempt's custody or mark canonical tasks done. Input
  assignments are released without delivery acknowledgements. Closing a group
  fences creator batches containing its peer input, while unrelated live input
  becomes separately schedulable after inspection.
- Added the private runner operation endpoint with strict typed bodies. The new
  HTTP test caught Serde ignoring extra fields on a unit enum variant; Close now
  uses an empty struct variant and the original refusal assertion passes.
- All 80 native tests passed locally, zero failed or ignored. Coverage includes
  mutation/settlement rollback, stale/foreign/member authority, fresh rejoin,
  queued/leased/started/parked retirement, nested closure, restart, two shared
  readers retaining custody until both are inspected, and frozen input recovery.
  Workspace Clippy/rustfmt and diff checks passed. All 74 native spec selectors
  resolve; four scenarios plus boundary passed under agent-spec 1.4.0.
- Actual process stop observation, Matrix room membership, graph/task execution,
  final delivery and M4–M9 integration remain open. Fixture inspection records
  do not prove live process termination. Corrected native CI remains a gate for
  this commit. Original dirty checkout and deployed services remain unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 — Drain guardian reports after peer exit

- Conversation lifecycle commit 403833c passed native Ubuntu/Windows CI. macOS
  failed native_guardian_early_exit with OS EINVAL while receiving the terminal
  report; Native Rust run 34487513248 remains a failed run. The new business
  lifecycle and HTTP tests passed on macOS too.
- A deterministic Unix socket fixture reproduced the cause: after the peer sends
  complete frames and closes, macOS rejects setting SO_RCVTIMEO before reading
  the still-buffered bytes. The original early-exit timing test passed 100 local
  repetitions, confirming that repetition alone did not cover this ordering.
- Replaced per-read/write socket timeout mutation with nonblocking IO and bounded
  poll readiness. Absolute deadlines, partial-frame age, EOF errors and size caps
  remain enforced. Channel configuration precedes host guardian spawn. A new
  fixture drains two terminal frames after peer exit and then requires EOF.
- The new fixture failed with EINVAL before the fix and passed after it. All 81
  native tests passed locally, zero failed or ignored, plus workspace Clippy and
  rustfmt. All 74 native selectors resolve, and the guardian lifecycle's four
  scenarios plus boundary passed. The extra Unix regression runs under the
  existing early-exit selector; Windows continues its real Job Object scenario.
- This fixes observation of an existing cleanup report. It does not establish
  guardian-death recovery, complete macOS descendant custody or actual native
  Agent execution. Corrected CI is still required; no live service was changed.

## 2026-09-10 — Durable native graphs and unknown execution custody

- Previous head 8aa01af passed Native Rust CI 34488421043 on Ubuntu, macOS and
  Windows, including release builds, and existing Node CI 34488421013.
- Schema 10 creates a finite graph and all canonical node tasks atomically, then
  admits ready immutable peer assignments with pinned dependency results. Exact
  current internal sessions, project generation and canonical task/assignment
  binding govern dispatch. Success requires explicit done for the exact task
  epoch; neither graph terminal state nor model output completes a parent task.
- Creator graph reads/cancellation and node result/dependency commands use the
  private runner API and single writer. Inspected result-only recovery can repeat
  a completed result, even for a terminal graph, without duplicating downstream
  work. Failed results deliberately fence the failed capability; after a lost
  response the creator reads the committed failure. There is no failed-capability
  exemption or runtime inspection endpoint.
- Result values remain outside graph views and assignment payloads. Metadata and
  bounded dependency references avoid repeated 64 KiB values across fan-out.
  Fractional conditions, ordering, skips and failure propagation retain the pure
  policy. Broad Unicode dependency failures remain valid within 4000 bytes.
- The user requested more parallel agents. Independent review reproduced two
  additional gaps: cancelled input exhausted a current member's pending quota,
  and expired shared readers lost resource custody before cancellation. Fixed
  both. All unresolved attempts now retain leases and concurrency slots until
  inspection. Recovery releases only its original leases transactionally, and
  schema 10 restores missing pre-fix unknown leases without reviving inspected
  attempts. Two-reader and late-transaction-failure fixtures verify isolation.
- The quota regression retains 4050 unacknowledged historical/live inputs, proves
  the actual 2000-live-input bound still rejects atomically, and permits new work
  after cancellation. Its initial unoptimized run was interrupted after 176.89
  seconds and is not passing evidence. Transaction-bound per-recipient counting
  and distinct assignee checks reduced the complete test to 4.74 seconds.
- Expanded schema verification initially exceeded SQLite's 64-table join limit.
  Independent verification queries now all prepare before migration commit and
  on reopen. A later failed statement rolls back the entire migration.
- All 94 local native tests passed, zero failed or ignored. Workspace Clippy,
  rustfmt and diff checks passed. All 81 native spec selectors resolve; seven
  graph scenarios plus boundary passed under agent-spec 1.4.0. Corrected CI for
  this new commit remains required. Native runtime protocol work is being
  developed independently and is not included in these counts.
- Actual model execution, graph tool adapters, final reply privacy/delivery,
  Matrix/Palpo transport, sandbox policy and remaining migration gates are open.
  Original dirty checkout and deployed services remain unchanged.


## 2026-09-10 — Native Codex protocol foundation in parallel worktree

- Implemented an independent M4 protocol slice on `feat/rust-runner-protocol`,
  based on committed 8aa01af while the primary worktree closes M3 graphs. Original
  dirty source checkout, active services and credentials were not changed.
- Added `hagency-runtime` with a bounded incremental JSONL codec and an IO-free
  host connection state. Integer/string identity namespaces, duplicate JSON keys,
  handshake order, absolute deadlines, finite pending requests and permanent
  server request tombstones are explicitly checked. No server success/allow
  response is implemented, and runtime text cannot settle work.
- Inspected installed Codex CLI 0.153.4 and exported its JSON schemas using its
  schema generator; committed selected schema snapshots/digests and reusable
  wire vectors. Checked the official App Server protocol documentation. No model
  execution or external-service test was run.
- Nine focused native tests pass, zero failed or ignored. They cover fragmented
  UTF-8, CRLF/coalesced lines, exact/oversized frames, invalid/duplicate fields,
  out-of-order/type-substituted RPC IDs, pending/lifetime limits, resolution before
  request, stale server requests, interruption ACK/error, timeout amid output,
  partial EOF, transport loss and sanitized locally generated errors. Rustfmt and
  focused Clippy pass. The initial Clippy run found one collapsible condition; it
  was corrected, with no suppressed lint or altered assertion.
- The new task contract parses and lints at 100% quality. agent-spec 1.4.0 lifecycle
  ran against `native/hagency-runtime`: all four scenario selectors execute real
  tests (3 + 2 + 2 + 2), and the explicit boundary check passes, 5/5 overall.
- This is protocol preparation only. Runtime IO/write ACK, typed thread/turn and
  approval authority, sandbox observation, process custody, real runtime platform
  qualification, task completion and final delivery remain integration gates.
  The primary agent will review this commit and run the combined workspace suite
  after the graph checkpoint; full old-workspace tests were not repeated here.

- Independent parallel review found no blocking defect in the protocol foundation.
  Added direct coverage for outbound nesting refusal, EOF with a pending server
  request, initialize RPC failure and a valid frame followed by a malformed
  coalesced suffix. Also verified simultaneous host/server requests sharing the
  exact same ID remain separate. All nine expanded tests, focused Clippy and the
  four-scenario-plus-boundary lifecycle pass again; production code is unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 — Integrate the reviewed Codex protocol foundation

- Task graph commit a41ab10 passed Native Rust CI 34506422131 on Windows, macOS
  and Linux, including release builds. Its existing Node CI 34506422137 is still
  running; no uncompleted run is counted as passing.
- Integrated the independent protocol implementation as 13113ad and its review
  regressions as bd0ce65. Append-only coordination conflicts were resolved by
  preserving both the graph work and protocol work. No runtime logic conflicted.
- Combined workspace validation passed 103 tests, zero failed or ignored, plus
  Clippy, rustfmt and diff checks. All 85 native spec selectors resolve. The
  protocol lifecycle passed four scenarios plus boundary in the integrated tree.
- The new crate remains unlinked from native Agent execution. Its observations
  confer no dispatch, approval, task-completion or process-custody authority.
  Actual bounded transport and final-reply privacy/outbox work are proceeding in
  separate worktrees, along with the remaining source inventory classification.

## 2026-09-10 — Bound asynchronous native Codex transport

- Added the next independent M4 slice in the runner worktree: an async driver
  around the existing protocol, taking three host-owned read/write streams. It
  creates no process, channel, background task or public endpoint. Existing
  deployed services and the original dirty checkout remain unchanged.
- The driver pumps stdout/stderr while a complete stdin frame and flush are
  pending. Its write receipt is separate from RPC responses and domain ACK.
  Dropped operation futures synchronously close streams and poison the connection;
  partial/failed output cannot replay. Termination retains unresolved byte/RPC
  progress, including counts cleared internally by a failed protocol operation.
- Added Instant-derived absolute deadlines, cooperative yields under ready IO,
  fixed read buffers, count plus complete-byte event caps and a bounded private
  stderr tail with total bytes. Overflowing actionable events close visibly.
  These byte caps do not claim an equivalent process RSS budget.
- All 17 focused runtime tests pass: nine protocol tests and eight new transport
  tests, zero failed or ignored. Real bounded duplex fixtures cover early RPC
  responses, partial/blocked writes, stalled flush, IO loss, partial/idle EOF,
  future cancellation, absolute deadlines, slow input, event pressure and stderr
  truncation. Most timing uses a deterministic clock; real timer tests also
  verify silence and continuously ready stdout without a producer sleep.
- Focused all-target Clippy, workspace rustfmt and diff checks pass. Initial
  compilation caught overlapping mutable write/flush borrows; the driver now
  polls one output operation per iteration. The initial Clippy run caught a
  constant assertion, which now runs at compile time without a suppressed lint.
- The scoped contract parses and lints at 100% quality. agent-spec 1.4.0 lifecycle
  runs the four selectors against the runtime crate (1 + 2 + 3 + 2 actual tests)
  plus the explicit boundary check, all five passing. ADR-034 records the exact
  guarantees and open integration work.
- Stream closure remains an unresolved execution outcome, requiring future host
  fencing and guardian inspection. It proves no process stop, released resource
  lease, canonical completion or Matrix delivery. The existing guardian's inactive
  stdio launch, actual runtime qualification and permission/sandbox integration
  are unchanged and remain gates before enabling native Agent execution.

## 2026-09-10 — Verify integrated native transport

- Combined protocol head 63b84b4 passed Native CI 34507529088 on all three
  operating systems and Node CI 34507529055. The graph checkpoint's Node CI
  34506422137 also completed successfully after the earlier progress entry.
- Integrated the reviewed host-stream transport as 00155ac. The only conflict
  was append-only progress text; both independent work records are preserved.
- All 111 combined native tests pass, zero failed or ignored. Workspace Clippy,
  rustfmt and diff checks pass. All 89 native selectors resolve, and the transport
  lifecycle passes four scenarios plus boundary in this integrated tree. The
  first lifecycle invocation had an invalid CLI argument layout; the corrected
  invocation used repeated --change options and executed the actual selectors.
- These results validate bounded stream transport, not actual model execution,
  effective sandbox permissions or process cleanup. The parallel agent continues
  with typed thread/turn handling while final-reply custody and source inventory
  work remain under independent review. Deployed services remain unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 — Source-derived native migration entrypoint inventory

- Isolated `feat/rust-inventory` worktree starts at `a41ab10`. The behavioral
  baseline remains `5dbef22`; source evidence pins the expanded snapshot to
  `a41ab10` and hashes every inspected JavaScript source and helper candidate.
  Original dirty checkout, deployed services, credentials and runtime data were
  not changed.
- Replaced regex candidates with deterministic Espree syntax inspection: 199
  Express routes and 3 middleware registrations; 12 custom branches through two
  raw listeners; 32 CLI declarations; 32 root/remote MCP registrations representing
  16 names; and 61 Next proxy rules across four method exports. Dynamic SSE
  installation, delivery delegation and inbound/outbound fleet protocol call
  sites retain exact source locations. Parsing imports no application module.
- Explicitly classified 138 helpers by role, owner, phase, disposition and gate.
  Installed autodeploy watchers and runtime team provisioning are not build-only;
  audit/CD helpers have a dual-use role. The checker refuses unresolved recognized
  registrations, unclassified listeners/helpers, stale module links and snapshot
  drift. Reflection, arbitrary aliases, generated code, external SDK internals
  and a complete shell call graph remain declared detection limits in ADR-035.
- Espree 11.2.0 is a direct pinned devDependency. Only root package/lock metadata
  changed; an isolated `npm ci --offline --ignore-scripts` completed successfully
  with 432 packages. This verifies the lock, not native-addon or production
  installation. Existing root/console development dependencies were linked into
  this worktree for checks; no install wrote through either shared link.
- Exact `tests/native-migration-inventory.test.js`: 3 passed, zero failed/skipped.
  Inventory reproduction, ESLint and diff checks passed. All 533 Node selectors
  resolve. The first binding scan failed due to absent Next dependencies in this
  worktree; after adding the existing console dependency link the full scan passed.
- Agent-spec 1.4.0 parse/lint passed, quality 100%, with advisory warnings.
  Lifecycle invoked with `--layers lint,boundary` still attempted Cargo test
  selectors and returned `passed:false`, `failed:0`, `passed:0`, `skipped:3`,
  `uncertain:0` (exit 1). These are Node/Vitest selectors; this lifecycle remains
  non-passing and is not counted as test evidence. Full output is retained in the
  local migration validation cache as `inventory-lifecycle.json`; actual Vitest
  evidence is `inventory-tests-final.log` and Node bindings are
  `inventory-bindings-final.log` in the 2026-09-10 cache directory.
- Source classification does not finish M0 or establish native parity. Every row
  remains `parity-unverified`. Complete event/schema/feature traceability, exact
  supported runtime versions, qualified hardware/libc and measured budgets,
  terminal/sandbox/guardian behavior, live transport/browser integration,
  packaging, soak and controlled cutover gates remain open. No model or homeserver
  was contacted by this slice.

## 2026-09-10 — Native final-reply intent and private route custody

- Isolated worktree based on a41ab10 adds schema 11 and ADR-033. Fresh Matrix
  sessions freeze host-observed server, account/device, project owner, explicit
  privacy and generations. Legacy sessions remain without delivery authority;
  internal sessions remain internal. The existing internal-kind uniqueness and
  rejoin policy is preserved.
- Full room snapshots retain members and invitation policy. Current negative
  evidence durably retires old routes and internal descendants; unknown/missing
  rooms have an explicit host invalidation command. A newer snapshot through one
  group Agent also fences another Agent that left. Restoring access requires
  renewed evidence and a fresh SID; null-root DM sessions cannot survive promotion.
- The runtime API admits only call ID and bounded final content under exact
  canonical Done-epoch or inspected-report authority. One immutable intent per
  task epoch has content-bound call receipts. No reply marks a task done and no
  runtime command chooses transport identity or asserts external delivery.
- Host claim, begin-send, observed delivery and inspection have distinct durable
  transitions. Lost/unstarted claims can retry; possible sends remain Uncertain.
  Explicit cancellation persists independently, so a later NotSent observation
  cannot revive cancelled output. Replayed inspection binds exact content/fence;
  an actual delivered observation records truth without authorizing another send.
- Parent review found the cancellation-revival and discarded-negative-observation
  gaps before commit; both are closed with restart and two-Agent membership tests.
  The initial new migration fixture reused the original work payload and correctly
  failed inspected recovery; it now uses a distinct report-only instruction. The
  Clippy requested equivalent boolean and Result-return simplifications.
- All 105 workspace tests passed locally, zero failed or ignored, including ten
  final-reply repository tests, private HTTP, migration and internal rejoin cases.
  Existing guardian/crypto/graph tests are included; this worktree does not yet
  include the independently developed Codex protocol crate. Logs are under the
  operator cache path, not the repository. Workspace Clippy and rustfmt pass;
  all 87 native spec selectors resolve and the final-reply lifecycle passes
  six scenarios plus boundary. CI for the combined commit is pending.
- This is an offline domain/API proof. Actual Matrix authentication, task-intent
  route integration, encryption/send/inspection, arbitrary first invited groups,
  non-owner/federated DM policy, taskless/front-desk output and live end-to-end
  tests remain open. No deployed service, credential, model or live room changed.

## 2026-09-10 — Integrate inventory and private final-reply custody

- Integrated source inventory as bf7a47d and final-reply custody as b89c576.
  Only append-only coordination files conflicted; all independent records were
  retained. The native README now states the current checkpoint and reply API.
- Combined native workspace: 122 passed, zero failed or ignored, plus Clippy and
  rustfmt. All 95 native selectors resolve. The integrated final-reply lifecycle
  passes six scenarios plus boundary, with zero skipped or uncertain results.
- Exact inventory Vitest: three passed, zero failed/skipped. Inventory reproduction,
  ESLint, diff and README link checks pass. All 533 Node selectors resolve. Its
  Cargo-only lifecycle limitation remains non-passing as recorded above; the
  successful Vitest run is the applicable test evidence.
- Prior transport head c1daf95 passed Native CI 34509445157 on all three OSes.
  New integrated CI is still required. No live runtime or Matrix state was touched.
- Parallel work continues on verified Matrix ingress/task-intent integration,
  Codex one-turn session handling and durable outbound custody. Machine-token
  rotation is separate from AS registration replacement; already received work
  must survive the former. No migration phase is declared complete by this check.
## 2026-09-10 — M4 typed Codex session slice (ADR-036)

Added a one-turn host-owned SessionDriver over the bounded protocol/transport.
Fixed workspace-write/on-request/user settings (optional read-only), bounded
absolute cwd/model/effort, exact resumed-thread/returned-turn correlation and
item tombstones now gate lifecycle observations. Early notifications are bounded
and scoped before activity is applied. Text and final separators count toward
explicit limits; server requests return unsupported errors. Cancellation, EOF
and timeout remain unknown execution, without task, lease or process transitions.

Root review identified inconsistent terminal-suffix handling. The wrapper now
validates received deferred/transport data consistently and finishes an already-
started trailing frame under an absolute bound. Every byte split of a normal
completed-plus-idle stream and completion/idle before interrupt ACK are covered;
wrong-scope, unsupported and unfinished suffixes fail visibly.

Focused verification in the isolated runner-protocol worktree: all 34 runtime
tests passed (9 protocol, 8 transport, 17 session), runtime all-target Clippy with
warnings denied passed, workspace formatting and diff checks passed. The fixture
uses the existing local Codex 0.153.4 schema export and records source hashes;
no model or service was started. Agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle passed all 4 scenarios
plus the explicit 13-file boundary check (5/5, quality 100%, zero fail/skip/uncertain);
its selectors ran 3 settings, 4 identity, 4 item and 6 outcome tests. Native execution
stays disabled until actual guardian/stdio,
input acknowledgement, sandbox, host authority and durable-domain gates close.

## 2026-09-10 — Native execution permission scope port

- Integrated the reviewed typed Codex session as 7a16b86, then added ADR-039's
  pure permission-scope and YOLO policy validation. Scope derivation never applies
  an owner decision or changes runtime permissions. Exact commands, structured
  network hosts and explicit permission profiles bind workspace/write/environment.
- Sixty-four vectors are generated from the existing pure JavaScript module with
  both standard path flavors. Native entry ordering is deliberately deterministic
  UTF-16 rather than locale-dependent; unsupported Windows device/root-relative
  paths remain once/deny-only. Metadata, description and array limits fail closed.
- All 143 combined native tests pass, zero failed or ignored. Workspace Clippy,
  rustfmt, diff and vector/ESLint checks pass; all 103 native selectors resolve.
  Logs: combined-session-execution-{tests,clippy}.log and bindings.json in the
  2026-09-10 local migration validation cache. Execution scope lifecycle passes
  four scenarios plus the 12-file boundary, quality 100%, zero fail/skip/uncertain.
- Integrated prior head 6906851 passed Native CI 34511063114 on all three OSes
  and Node CI 34511063106. New combined head still requires CI.
- Native grant persistence, exact private owner decisions, binding/task epochs,
  runner responses, YOLO dispatch and effective sandbox remain implementation
  work. The parallel guardian-owned stdio, verified ingress and outbound custody
  slices continue; production runtimes and live Matrix state remain unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 — Native outbound custody lifecycle

- Separate `feat/rust-outbound-custody` worktree starts at `bf7a47d`. Custody
  schema 2 extends the existing repository/worker; domain schema, original dirty
  checkout and services were not changed. Palpo source was read-only at
  `c7c400e04ab05479a63c30f14679ec0180457d85`; no live version claim is made.
- Host-only activation pins canonical side/fleet/registration identity and refuses
  fixture adoption or another binding namespace for the same fleet. A stable
  UUID consumer survives machine rotation. Opaque scopes/tickets have no
  Deserialize, Serialize or Debug projection. Machine and Matrix registration
  generations stay separate, including the delivery's preserved origin.
- Receive commits the full JSON transaction and content-bound receipt before ACK.
  Current poll and exact lease tickets reject replaced/stale responses. Retirement
  of an uncertain machine lease is explicit; rotation never invents a successful
  remote ACK. Already owned Matrix/request work stays recoverable. Old probe
  processing and publication authority is fenced.
- Claims/start/result receipts commit atomically. Startup/expiry retire unstarted
  claims, while started or explicitly uncertain work requires host inspection.
  Matrix order is preserved and the separate work lane continues. Completion
  compacts only payload, preserving arbitrary-ID dedup and exact result receipts.
  No domain task or request approval is inferred from transport completion.
- The one-slot publication outbox preserves sequence, bytes and original
  observedAt timestamps across lost/rejected responses. Exact acceptance receipts
  cannot clear a newer body. Current probe publication requires an equal completed
  work-probe result from the exact machine generation. The later Matrix adapter
  must also suppress embedded old-generation probe evidence in retained full
  transactions; no authenticated source/event or connection proof is fabricated.
- Shared JavaScript vectors verify opaque full transactions, prototype-named data,
  fractional/exponent numbers, Unicode and numeric keys. Existing signed DTO and
  execution-payload encoders remain strict. Queue accounting covers serialized
  payload plus escaped envelopes and maximum lease tokens; stored payload/result/
  publication bytes share the 16 MiB bound. Finite records/attempts never evict
  pending work or historical dedup markers for capacity.
- Independent review found that the original queued command reused its enqueue
  clock. The writer now advances a host-clock anchor by monotonic elapsed time,
  rounding up milliseconds. A controlled paused-writer regression proves queued
  Start and Complete cannot use authority that expired while queued.
- Ten focused outbound tests passed. All 74 core/store tests passed, zero failed
  or ignored; this includes existing custody and domain regressions. Clippy with
  warnings denied, rustfmt and diff checks passed. All 95 native selectors on this
  base resolve. Agent-spec 1.4.0 parse/lint scored 100%; exact lifecycle passed
  six scenarios plus the explicit boundary (7 pass, 0 fail/skip/uncertain).
  Output is retained in the local 2026-09-10 migration validation cache as
  `outbound-tests.log`, `outbound-full-tests.log`, `outbound-bindings.log` and
  `outbound-lifecycle.json`. Cross-platform CI for this slice remains required.
- ADR-037 records the host boundary and next gates: actual HTTPS/wire validation,
  credential ownership, Matrix source/membership proof, domain handoff, bounded
  status observation and network loops. This task added no client crate, ran no
  model/homeserver/browser and made no deployment. Continuous retention beyond
  finite custody capacity remains a release gate.
## 2026-09-10 — Verified Matrix input to canonical task integration

- Isolated worktree based on b89c576 adds schema 12 and ADR-038. Host-only typed
  observations bind current full Matrix identity and generations; runtime HTTP
  cannot choose input target, wake policy or transport truth. Legacy intake stays
  fenced from verified sessions.
- Current joined-human and full-MXID mention evidence derives wake. Direct main
  stays null-root without @; Agent/service messages remain background. Independent
  session/task copies retain exact original source SIDs, body and scope receipts.
  Task creation, dormant input, ACK and request dedup commit atomically.
- Actual ACK observation activates canonical work; frozen dispatch and original-
  human follow-up carry the same task through canonical epochs to final intent.
  Repository and HTTP fixtures now begin with admitted input instead of manually
  creating the task. Wrong device/sender/content, runtime forged fields, promoted
  null-root DM, retired parent, allocation/device rotation, missing legacy
  boundaries, transaction failure and restart have deterministic coverage.
- Review retained the live notice adapter as an explicit unimplemented gate:
  claim/reclaim alone lacks begin-send and uncertain-send custody. A later rejected
  ACK cannot undo a delayed private send. ADR/spec and API comments require current
  route validation, cancellation and durable uncertainty before any live adapter.
  Self-review also added parent provenance for pre-resolved explicit threads.
- Validation found three existing migration expectations still naming schema 11;
  they now assert 12. New HTTP fixtures initially used the wrong App constructor
  arguments and response nesting, and one follow-up fixture expected epoch 2 after
  a second Done although the canonical result is 3. These fixture failures are
  preserved in cache logs. Clippy requested a grouped projection argument and
  removal of redundant borrows in the shared intent persistence helper.
- The full native workspace passed 131 tests with zero failures or ignored tests;
  workspace Clippy, rustfmt, task parse/lint and final lifecycle pass. All seven
  scenarios plus boundary passed with zero skips/uncertain results, and all 102
  native spec selectors resolve. The final workspace rerun after helper cleanup
  also passed 131 tests. Logs live under the operator cache, outside the repo.
- No model, live Matrix service, credential or deployment changed. Real sync/crypto
  and transport, generalized invitation/DM policy, taskless/front-desk output,
  automatic unread discussion-window selection and migration cutover remain open.

## 2026-09-10 — Windows execution-vector reproducibility

- Head 8ba0590 passed Node CI 34513475238 but failed the Windows native vector
  check in 34513475271. The legacy source is checked out with CRLF there; its raw
  source hash differed while the permission vectors were unchanged. The generator
  now hashes canonical LF source text. Native JSON fixture bytes remain LF.
- Both ordinary input and an in-memory simulated CRLF checkout reproduce all 64
  vectors locally; ESLint and diff checks pass. The next Windows CI run must
  verify the fix; this local simulation is not substituted for that run.
- Outbound custody is integrated as ffaad85 and verified ingress as 7eabc42.
  Only append-only coordination records conflicted; both histories were retained.
  Their combined full-workspace verification is still in progress alongside the
  native task-client integration. Deployed services remain unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 — Native task maintenance CLI

- Added task get/start/heartbeat/wait/resume/done/comment to the native executable.
  An inherited exact runner context chooses one task and loopback socket; mutation
  call IDs go to the existing scoped API and sole canonical writer. Credentials
  never enter CLI arguments, configuration or model-visible output.
- Actual local Salvo/SQLite fixtures and the native executable verify lifecycle,
  identical retries, changed-content conflict, wrong task/secret/fence, parked
  rejection and sanitized failure. Controlled peers verify redirects, excess
  headers/chunked data, partial EOF and stalled body cancellation without retry.
- Four task-client tests and workspace Clippy pass. Only direct dependency entries
  for already-locked Hyper/Hyper-util/http-body-util were added; no package version
  changed. Combined ingress/outbound/client validation passed 166 native tests
  with zero failures or ignored tests; all 120 Rust spec selectors resolve.
  Integrated agent-spec lifecycle passed task client 5/5, outbound custody 7/7
  and verified ingress 8/8, including explicit file boundaries and no skips or
  uncertain results. Logs are in the 2026-09-10 migration cache. Windows CI for
  the line-ending correction remains pending the next push.
- Host environment provisioning and full legacy/MCP helper parity are not enabled
  by this CLI. The production service and original checkout remain unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 — M4 owned child stdio integration (ADR-040)

Added SupervisedProcess::spawn_piped and one-use StdioPipes through the existing
guardian prepare/start and retained child-identity launcher. Exactly three
checked endpoints cross the private socket before Start. OwnedSession consumes
native Tokio Unix pipe adapters and retains process custody through completion,
EOF, timeout and dropped-operation cancellation. Protocol outcome and exact
platform termination report remain separate. Its bounded synchronous stop can
block an execution worker; nonblocking server orchestration is not claimed.

The offline native fixture now traverses initialize, initialized, thread/start,
turn/start, streamed item text and completion over actual child pipes. It also
exercises a failed executable, silent and closed output, a cancelled partially
written request, 256 KiB stderr pressure, a child surviving stream closure, and
an independently observed descendant. It never launches a model or live service.

Adversarial descriptor tests exposed a real macOS truncation hazard during
development: the original ancillary header can exceed copied control bytes and
the kernel can install descriptor IDs omitted by truncation. The receiver now
uses a source-bound 4 KiB buffer and exits its disposable pre-start process on
macOS truncation; a subprocess test verifies exit 125 and closure of undisclosed
rights. Parser traversal and payload lengths are bounded before reads. Test
pipes were also sealed to avoid unrelated concurrent fixture inheritance.
Parent review requested the defensive control-length clamp and it is included.

A final test pass exposed an overly strong stderr fixture expectation: terminal
stdout can close streams while a final chunk remains in the kernel. The test
now checks observed drainage and exact bounded tail content, without equating
produced bytes with observed bytes. Descendant markers were separated and must
show activity before protocol completion, removing a weak shared-file assertion.

Focused platform/runtime verification passed 59 tests locally on macOS 26.5 /
Darwin 25.5.0 (19 platform and 40 runtime), zero failed or ignored. Linux-specific
subreaper/ancillary tests and Windows refusal still require their CI hosts.
Windows cancellable piped IO remains Unsupported; atomic job launching is
unchanged. POSIX crash-containment refusal and macOS incomplete descendant
reports remain intact. Real sandbox/runtime qualification, guardian-death
recovery, authenticated dispatch and durable task/lease settlement remain open.
Native execution stays disabled; no migration phase is declared complete.

All-target focused Clippy with warnings denied, workspace formatting and diff
checks passed. Agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle passed all four bound scenarios plus the
explicit 20-file boundary check (5/5, quality 98%, zero fail/skip/uncertain).
Selectors ran 1 lifecycle, 1 admission, 2 IO-failure and 2 custody tests; platform
ancillary unit evidence comes from the separate focused platform test run.
Logs and the exact lifecycle command are in the operator migration cache outside
the repository. No changes were pushed, merged or deployed from this worktree.

## 2026-09-10 — Combined native client and owned runner verification

- Integrated native task CLI as dbf3162 and owned child IO as 1609289. Review
  confirmed exact framed guardian reads do not consume the ancillary marker;
  disposable pre-start macOS failure handling and bounded owner stop remain
  explicit. Append-only coordination conflicts preserve both histories.
- All 176 native workspace tests passed, zero failed or ignored. Workspace
  Clippy, rustfmt and diff checks passed; all 124 native selectors resolve.
  Integrated owned-IO lifecycle passed 5/5 with zero skips or uncertainty.
  Combined logs are in the migration cache as combined-owned-cli-* and
  combined-owned-io-lifecycle.json. Cross-platform CI is pending this push.
- Parallel work continues on Windows cancellable pipes, outbound HTTPS and
  persisted owner approvals. No deployed service or original checkout changed.

## 2026-09-10 — Durable private owner decisions and exact approval application

- Isolated worktree based on 7eabc42 adds schema 13 and ADR-043. Full shared
  project-owner approval-room observations derive private authority; per-Agent
  incarnations remain separate. Current negative evidence, including a conflicting
  same-generation snapshot, retires all old room bindings and grants. Positive
  replay cannot restore them. Project/owner/registration and allocation changes
  revoke old grants durably.
- Host context pins current capability, verified Matrix session, canonical task
  epoch, exact native connection/thread/turn/item and leased workspace. Request
  admission and parking commit together. Core execution scope derivation supplies
  exact reusable command/network/profile candidates; unknown writable requests
  retain once/deny. Read-only escalation is limited to network-only scope and YOLO
  is refused pending operator policy plus actual sandbox/runtime integration.
- Structured encrypted owner verdicts commit content-bound receipts and grants
  atomically. Task grants stop at completion/epoch change; Always grants survive a
  clean dispatch/restart only under the same Agent/private/workspace context.
  Explicit revocation after decision but before consumption prevents another allow.
- Consumption persists Applying once before returning host application data. Lost
  response/restart remains Uncertain, and neither NotApplied nor expired authority
  can rearm it. Exact observed application may record old truth without resuming
  an expired dispatch. Every unresolved approval blocks the generic resume path.
  Public/console summaries omit private room, owner, workspace, source and payload.
- Parent review found the same-generation negative-evidence gap; a regression now
  covers B invalidating A's decided reusable request, old safe replay and fresh
  generation restoration. Additional fixtures cover shared-room cross-project
  refusal, exact ID types, wrong owner/scope/capability, multiple requests, injected
  rollback, pending limits, private projections, clean grant restart and schema
  upgrade. One existing schema assertion still expected 12 and now asserts 13.
- Final full native workspace: 172 tests passed, zero failed or ignored, including
  ten approval test groups. Workspace Clippy, rustfmt, spec parse/lint and lifecycle
  pass; all six scenarios plus boundary passed with zero skipped/uncertain results.
  All 122 native spec selectors resolve. Logs live in the operator cache outside
  the repository; the earlier fixture/compiler and schema-expectation failures
  remain in their original logs.
- No live Matrix/model/runtime, credential or deployed service changed. Native
  decision wiring, application inspection adapters, Matrix cards/verdict crypto,
  operator YOLO policy, general owner rebinding and M6/M9 operational gates remain
  open. Task-notice sending retains its separate custody gate from ADR-038.

- Windows follow-up: the schema reconstruction fixture sliced at a literal blank
  line before CREATE TABLE, which failed under CRLF checkout. It now locates SQL
  statement text independently of line endings. An in-memory fixture reconstructs
  and prepares the route view under both LF and CRLF; focused test and Clippy pass.

## 2026-09-10 — M5 bounded outbound HTTP client, isolated worktree

- `feat/rust-outbound-http` starts at integrated custody commit `ffaad85` in its
  own clean worktree. Added `hagency-palpo` with immutable host configuration,
  pinned verified reqwest/rustls HTTPS, explicit bearer/generation, disabled
  proxies/redirects/protocol retries and finite DNS/concurrency/header/body/JSON/
  deadline/backoff budgets. No deployed service or original checkout changed.
- Matrix/work polling persists full payload before exact ACK. Cancellation,
  delayed/lost responses and rotation retain work plus explicit uncertainty.
  Host-only AckHead resumes current unconfirmed leases even for done redelivery
  tombstones, using existing schema-2 columns. Neither custody nor domain schema
  changes. FIFO Matrix consumption does not block work or frozen publication.
- Publication uses Palpo's actual `/updates` path and exact persisted v2 bytes,
  sequence and observedAt. Machine rotation fences old in-flight responses and
  credentials; old locally owned work retains its original generation. A simple
  heartbeat never manufactures Matrix readiness, membership or approval proof.
- Thirteen actual local HTTP/TLS fixtures passed, including TLS/hostname failure,
  environment proxies, redirects/status redaction, malformed/duplicate/coalesced/
  oversized JSON, slow headers/body/ACK, exact ACK-before-consumer ordering,
  response-loss/restart, done-tombstone ACK, changed replay, stale leases, token
  rotation, unknown attempts and independent cancellable lanes/backoff.
- The first fixture run exposed two incorrect test assumptions: retry Claim
  returns its original unknown capability, whose Start remains refused; a server
  sending ACK does not mean the client committed it before cancellation. Tests
  now explicitly verify these boundaries; no production guard was weakened.
- Additional reference check executed the pinned read-only Palpo commit
  `c7c400e04ab05479a63c30f14679ec0180457d85`'s real createApp/Outbound with only an
  in-memory database and forbidden homeserver I/O. The native client completed
  both lanes' ACK, full payload handoff, empty poll and frozen v1 status in a v2
  update. Palpo preserved old observedAt and remained pending_connection.
- Core/store/client integration passed 101 tests, zero failed/ignored (plus one
  isolated proxy-environment child invocation). All 114 native selectors resolve.
  Clippy with warnings denied, rustfmt and diff checks passed. Agent-spec 1.4.0
  parse/lint scored 100%; scoped lifecycle passed five scenarios plus boundary,
  six pass and zero fail/skip/uncertain. Evidence logs in the local 2026-09-10
  migration cache use prefix `outbound-http-`: fixtures-final, all-tests, clippy,
  bindings, lifecycle and palpo-reference.
- Initial offline dependency resolution downgraded seven uncached WASM/Hermit
  target packages; those baseline blocks were restored. Matching new
  wasm-bindgen-futures 0.4.78 comes from cached registry metadata. Every existing
  lock version/checksum remains unchanged and `cargo check --locked --offline`
  passes. New dependencies are scoped to the client/TLS fixture; no broad upgrade.
- ADR-042 and the crate README state remaining gates: secure host configuration
  persistence, current domain catalog/status observation, authenticated Matrix
  SDK event/member proof, idempotent domain handoff, Agent retirement endpoint,
  continuous retention/capacity maintenance, platform CI and live UX. This does
  not declare M5 or the full migration complete. No model or deployment was run.

## 2026-09-10 — Task notice send custody and integrated outbound/approval checks

- Integrated private owner decisions as 36366bb and outbound HTTP as c52a97c.
  Root reviewed exact ACK recovery, TLS/configuration bounds, independent lanes,
  scope matching and one-shot approval application. Append-only coordination
  conflicts preserve both histories; existing lock packages remain pinned.
- Added schema14 and ADR045: verified notices commit Sending once before host
  send data is returned, freeze the canonical epoch/source, and retain possible
  sends as Uncertain. Promotion, revocation and explicit cancellation fence old
  output; late delivery can record history without activating retired work.
  Exact fenced inspection receipts and rollback protect activation. Generic
  legacy failure/retry cannot bypass this path. Older development notices are
  conservatively fenced because their original epoch/send-start was not recorded.
- Four new repository test groups cover direct/group activation, one-shot begin,
  rollback, wrong secrets, expiry/restart, explicit cancellation, late delivery,
  inspection conflict, epoch change and old-schema migration. Existing verified
  ingress and actual scoped HTTP fixtures now call begin before delivery.
- First combined run exposed one stale graph schema expectation (13 versus 14);
  it was corrected. Final combined workspace passed 204 tests, zero failures or
  ignored tests, plus the HTTP proxy fixture's isolated child invocation.
  Workspace Clippy/fmt pass; all 139 native selectors resolve. Logs use prefix
  combined-notice-http-approval-* in the local migration validation cache.
  Integrated lifecycle passed notice custody 5/5, owner approvals 7/7 and
  outbound HTTP 6/6, all with explicit boundaries and zero skipped/uncertain.
- Native CI d66b4e9 (34516408230) passed Linux and macOS. Windows passed the
  corrected execution-vector check, then exposed CRLF SQL fixture slicing and
  missing SystemRoot in the isolated task-client process. The fixture fixes are
  committed as 5c3d764 and 45f4a62; actual Windows rerun remains required.
- Actual Matrix sends, crypto/recipient handling, runtime approval application
  and Windows owned pipes remain in progress. No deployed service, credential
  or original dirty checkout changed; no migration phase is declared complete.

## 2026-09-10 — M4 Windows owned stdio adapter (ADR-044)

Added Windows local self-connected pipes with owner-only access and exact child
handle inheritance through the existing atomic Job Object launcher. Host endpoints
are overlapped and non-inheritable. OwnedSession now shares its original guards
between platforms through an owned/session.rs extraction; its Unix conversion and
guardian path are retained. Incomplete stop observations remain explicit and can
be retried. Native service execution stays disabled.

Local dependency inspection found that Tokio/Mio flush and drop behavior cannot
establish the required write/cancel boundary. A private platform adapter now
bounds each write, waits for the pinned Mio previous-write completion check, and
disconnects plus requests cancellation of every pending operation before drop.
No blocking IO reader or alternate child launcher was added. ADR-044 records
source versions/hashes and the implementation dependency that future upgrades
must requalify. Complete write still does not establish domain acknowledgement.

Windows fixtures now use actual child IO for the full offline Codex lifecycle,
partial writes, EOF, silence, stderr pressure, ordinary and new-group descendants.
Separate tests exercise exact handle exclusion, job membership before input,
blocked single-write completion, disconnecting pending IO, denied breakaway and
owner exit without Drop. Shared test cleanup keeps true platform guarantees.
No model, external service, runtime token or deployed process was touched.

A shared fixture regression was caught locally: allowing the Unix child to read
a small prefix freed enough anonymous-pipe capacity for the entire request, so
the timeout moved from write to response. Prefix consumption is now Windows-only,
where confirmed write counts may remain zero despite partial delivery. The Unix
fixture retains its original blocked-write proof. Cross-target Clippy also caught
a Windows-only unused fixture assignment; it was removed without suppressing lint.

All 59 platform/runtime tests passed on macOS, zero failed or ignored. All-target
Clippy with warnings denied passed for Windows GNU and Linux GNU cross-targets;
cross-compilation does not execute the Windows fixtures. Real Windows CI remains
an open qualification gate, as do effective sandbox/runtime tests, POSIX guardian
loss, macOS complete detached-child proof and authenticated dispatch/approval
integration. This code does not close M4 or advertise runtime availability.

Final source review found upstream Mio #1944: reactor teardown can abandon late
pipe completions and retain handles. With coordinator agreement, Windows pipes
now register on one private process-lifetime completion reactor with one fixed
worker. It exposes no arbitrary spawn or command API. A Windows fixture cycles
32 short-lived caller runtimes, cancels pending reads, observes disconnect/EOF,
and checks actual process handle counts. This adds explicit completion custody
without another process launcher or blocking pipe reader; Windows execution of
the fixture remains pending CI.

Final macOS Clippy, Windows cross-target Clippy, formatting and diff checks pass.
Agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle passes four shared scenarios and the explicit 18-file
boundary (5/5, quality 97%, zero fail/skip/uncertain). That lifecycle executed six
shared runtime tests on macOS; it did not execute Windows-only scenarios.
Exact commands and logs are saved under the operator migration cache's
codex-protocol/windows-io-* paths. No push, merge or deployment was performed.

## 2026-09-10 — Integrated Windows IO review and three-OS regression results

Integrated ADR-044 as 4c0de90. The combined platform/runtime suite passed all
59 macOS tests; workspace Clippy, formatting and diff checks passed. Integrated
agent-spec lifecycle passed 5/5 including the explicit file boundary, with zero
fail/skip/uncertain. Its six selected shared tests ran on macOS; Windows-specific
execution is still pending the new CI run.

Previous integrated head 47b6a51 passed Native CI 34518706774 on Windows 2025,
macOS 15 and Ubuntu 24.04. This verifies the SystemRoot task-client fixture fix
and CRLF migration-fixture correction on actual Windows. That run predates the
new Windows IO code. Local full-workspace evidence at 47b6a51 remains 204 unique
tests plus the isolated proxy-environment child check. Node CI 34518706889 was
still running when this entry was recorded. Logs remain in the private operator
migration cache. No live service or original dirty checkout changed.

## 2026-09-10 — Native MCP assigned-task helper (ADR-049)

Added an executable stdio MCP helper using the existing task-client transport
and sole canonical writer. Its five tools preserve exact task/capability scope
and stable mutation call IDs. Native fixtures exercise lifecycle, task transitions,
replay/conflict, wrong task, wrong secret, parked authority, bounded malformed
frames, duplicate IDs, EOF and whole-helper IO deadlines. The actual pinned
rmcp 1.8 client initializes a native child and reads/mutates a fresh API task.

The first SDK run exposed its automatic _meta progress data on tools/list; the
adapter now accepts bounded metadata without deriving authority. Independent
review caught unknown tools being represented as execution errors; they and
invalid call envelopes now return JSON-RPC -32602 while leaving the connection
usable. Added independent connection replay coverage. The watchdog was confined
to the binary's private module; a library caller cannot invoke process exit.

Initial compilation lacked the test-only Tokio process feature; it is explicit
now. Offline dependency resolution tried unrelated WASM/Hermit downgrades; all
preexisting package versions were restored before locked verification. Eight
focused task-client/MCP tests passed before the final fresh-connection addition;
final checks and lifecycle are recorded below after completion. No live or
generated MCP configuration changed.

Final focused verification passed all eight MCP/task-client tests, and the added
fresh-connection replay/conflict test passed separately. Workspace Clippy with
warnings denied, formatting and diff checks passed. Agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle
passed all four scenarios plus the explicit 17-file boundary (5/5), zero
fail/skip/uncertain. Review independently exercised the rebuilt executable's
protocol-error recovery. SDK remains pinned as a dev dependency; native packaging
has no SDK requirement. New three-OS execution remains a CI gate.

## 2026-09-10 — Diagnose macOS child identity CI observation failure

Native CI 34519683281 failed `native_child_identity_expiry` at `68af16c` with
the fixture's "unrelated child was signalled" message. Its only evidence was no
heartbeat change during a fixed 80 ms sleep; it never checked child exit status.
The test finished within 0.84 seconds, below the probe's eight-second lifetime.
Tracing both rejected operations confirms they return before the native signal
call. The saved CI output cannot retrospectively establish the child's status.

A bounded, host-controlled native heartbeat pause now reproduces the unchanged
sample without any signal and verifies that the child is alive. The fixture
waits at most three seconds for fresh progress and checks the retained Child for
actual exit before accepting it. A killed-child negative case still fails even
with old heartbeat bytes present. Existing expiry, unrelated-survival and
generation assertions remain; production signal identity code is unchanged.
This was isolated from the unfinished Linux cgroup worktree.

Verification: all 20 macOS platform tests passed, including four child identity
tests; Clippy with warnings denied, formatting and diff checks passed. Agent-spec
1.4 lifecycle passed four scenarios and the five-file boundary (5/5, quality 93%,
zero fail/skip/uncertain). Evidence is in the operator cache at
`codex-protocol/child-progress-tests.log` and `child-progress-lifecycle.json`.
This local result is not a rerun of the failed GitHub macOS job.

### 2026-09-10 — M6 Codex approval protocol seam (ADR-046)

- Added opt-in typed command/file/permission approval events and exact once/deny
  responses while retaining default refusal. Correlation keeps request ID type,
  thread/turn/item and original content; consumed responses cannot be resent.
- Added `hagency-permissions` as the host coordinator over the unchanged schema13
  writer and independent runtime crate. It derives session execution context,
  proves current resource/owner authority, parks before approval and persists
  Applying before a response-byte attempt. No runtime payload supplies host
  identity, workspace lease, owner verdict, reusable grant or application truth.
- Audited official Codex 0.153.4 source at commit 3d2ee51: all three callbacks emit
  resolved before typed response parsing/core submission, including cancellation.
  The adapter therefore records uncertainty and never marks Applied or resumes
  dispatch from flush/resolution/model text. Live native approval remains gated
  on evidence after core application, not merely response delivery.
- Regression fixtures use real SQLite and fake bounded streams. They assert
  Applying in the writer before its first byte; cover allow/deny/profile shapes,
  default refusal, exact numeric/string IDs, stale private/device/lease authority,
  revoked grant becoming deny, DB rollback, 16 pending limit, multiple approvals,
  cancellation, timeout, EOF and durable restart. Early fixture model/opaque-ID
  mistakes were corrected; boxed fixture futures avoid test-stack overflow
  without changing stack settings. No production store rule was loosened.
- Final verification: 197 full native tests and 51 focused runtime/permissions
  tests pass, with zero failures or ignored tests. Clippy, rustfmt and diff
  whitespace checks pass. Task lifecycle has four passing scenarios plus the
  passing explicit boundary, zero skip/uncertain/pending-review; 134 native spec
  selectors resolve. Logs are in the external operator cache as
  `codex-approval-{workspace,tests,clippy,lifecycle-final,inventory}.log`.
- Review-added cancellation tests hold a SQLite write lock, poll attach/consume
  once, release the lock and confirm durable commit without repolling the caller.
  Dropping that future closes the channel; lost consumed decisions emit no bytes,
  cannot resend and reopen as Uncertain. The initial lifecycle boundary failure
  was the root-manifest path spelling; explicit `./Cargo.toml` and `./Cargo.lock`
  now match the already authorized files.

### 2026-09-10 — Codex approval one-response follow-up

- Generic server-request rejection now refuses a request that already emitted its
  typed approval response. Its original pending correlation remains intact until
  upstream resolution; a second typed response is likewise refused.
- A real Connection regression covers allow, rejected generic/typed duplicates,
  and accepted original resolution. Focused approval tests, runtime Clippy,
  rustfmt and task lifecycle pass (four scenarios plus boundary, no skips).
  Evidence: `codex-approval-one-response{,-clippy,-lifecycle}.log` in the external cache.

## 2026-09-10 — Integrated MCP, approval and child-observation checkpoint

Integrated native MCP as 363db02, the macOS fixture correction as 795ae94 and
Codex approval coordination as e5b4239. Full workspace verification passed 220
unique tests, zero failed or ignored, plus the isolated proxy-environment child
check (221 printed passes). Workspace Clippy with warnings denied, formatting
and diff checks passed; all 152 native spec selectors resolve. Integrated
approval and child-identity lifecycles each passed 5/5 with explicit boundaries
and zero fail/skip/uncertain.

Review found a connection-level duplicate response path: generic rejection could
follow a typed approval while correlation was retained. ec80da5 fences that
path without dropping pending resolution identity. Its three focused approval
tests passed; the writer/coordinator cannot resend a consumed approval.

Previous 68af16c passed Windows and Linux Native CI 34519683281, including actual
Windows owned-pipe cancellation/handle and child fixtures. macOS failed the old
80 ms heartbeat-only observation; the corrected fixture is now integrated and
new CI remains required. Node CI 34519683353 passed. The complete earlier
47b6a51 native three-OS and Node runs were green.

The parallel Matrix collector review identified shared negative snapshot loss,
lost positive-observation response fencing, SDK shutdown errors and plaintext
custom SDK values; fixes are still in its isolated worktree. Linux cgroup and
Matrix formatting also remain separate. This is a development checkpoint, not
completion of a migration phase. Original checkout and deployed processes are
unchanged.


### 2026-09-10 — Native Matrix account/device observations and global negative fencing

- Isolated branch `feat/rust-matrix-transport` starts at schema14 commit
  `47b6a51`. Task contract `task-rust-matrix-transport` and accepted ADR-047 govern
  this slice; no original checkout, deployed service, live account or key changed.
- Added `hagency-matrix`: actual pinned HTTPS whoami, bounded sync and authenticated
  full-room state feed the existing host domain observations. It uses protected
  encrypted SDK state/crypto stores and one owned worker; there is no message send,
  approval application or event admission. Exact account/device/registration,
  TLS origin and host room/generation intents remain separate from Palpo tokens.
- Domain schema15 persists exact transport unavailability, atomically retires old
  routes/own grants and retains possible final/notice sends as uncertain. Fresh
  generation is required after failure; stale negative evidence cannot revoke a
  newer incarnation. Migration fixtures preserve schema14 and reject partial or
  missing structure. Shared room failure also retires other Agents' old routes.
- Tests found and closed SDK custom-value plaintext storage and a fixture teardown
  race. Journal encryption is explicit; the pending fixture now writes through
  the owned worker. Interrupted sync retains its full encrypted original response
  and cannot automatically replay. Bounds reject capacity rather than pruning
  received work or dedup receipts. Database rollback and queued timeout tests
  preserve original receipts, keys and exclusive ownership.
- Parent review found three additional boundaries, all closed with regressions:
  shared unsafe snapshots must reach shared-room invalidation, a lost positive
  response must fence the attempted incarnation too, and SDK close errors must
  never report successful shutdown. The close acknowledgement follows runtime
  termination and filesystem lock release.
- Local validation: 225 workspace tests in 45 binaries pass, zero failed/ignored;
  146 native selectors all bind; workspace Clippy `-D warnings`, fmt and diff
  checks pass. Agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle is 8/8 with explicit changed boundaries,
  zero skipped/uncertain. Evidence is under the 2026-09-10 migration cache with
  `matrix-*` prefixes. Existing offline cross-signed crypto fixture also passes.
- Remaining gates are explicit: no live provisioning/key publication/cross-signing,
  Matrix event provenance or sends, pending-SDK inspection recovery, continuous
  retention beyond 64 sync receipts, changing the pinned room set, deployment UX
  or production cutover. If negative persistence itself is unavailable/unknown,
  a future live host must stop using that incarnation; a failed database cannot
  promise immediate retirement. This bounded slice does not complete M5.


### 2026-09-10 — Integrated Matrix collector and three-platform MCP/approval CI

Integrated Matrix transport a2c5621 as d898211, preserving the current Palpo,
permissions and Matrix workspace members without baseline dependency upgrades.
The combined workspace passed 241 unique tests plus the isolated proxy child
check (242 printed passes), zero failed/ignored. Clippy with warnings denied and
all 159 native selector bindings pass. Integrated Matrix lifecycle passes 8/8
with all 31 changed paths bound and zero fail/skip/uncertain. Evidence:
`combined-matrix-mcp-approval-*` and `integrated-matrix-lifecycle.*` in the
2026-09-10 migration cache.

At prior head 911f1f5, Native CI 34522180950 passed on actual Linux, macOS and
Windows runners, and Node CI 34522180924 passed. This closes the prior macOS
child-progress fixture failure and qualifies the MCP/approval integration on
those runners. Matrix collector CI requires the next push; local validation
is not substituted for that result.

Three parallel agents remain active: MCP coordination/delegation/task graphs,
Matrix formatting with JS vectors, and namespace-qualified Linux cgroup cleanup
fixtures. Production execution, Matrix event admission/sends, retained migration
phases and controlled cutover are still open; original/live state is unchanged.

### 2026-09-10 — M6 native Matrix content formatting proof (ADR050)

- Added the isolated `hagency-matrix-format` crate with a bounded serializable
  content DTO. It preserves plaintext, thread/reply/edit relations and existing
  caller-trusted formatted content. Generated Markdown uses the retained Matrix
  tag/attribute/scheme allowlist, with raw HTML parsing disabled and no transport
  or routing authority. No live JavaScript or Matrix path was changed.
- Captured 63 byte-exact JavaScript vectors from pinned markdown-it15.0.1,
  sanitize-html2.17.7 and linkify-it6.1.0, with source/Node-lock hashes and a
  reproducible check mode. Native CI installs locked production dependencies
  with all scripts disabled before executing this pure oracle. A clean external
  cache installation reproduced the check successfully.
- Rejected a candidate parser after reproducing its emphasis source-map panic;
  the pinned selected markdown1.0.0 parser passes that fixture. Adaptations cover
  reference rejection, line breaks, tables, images, safe URL schemes, raw
  punycode, Unicode punctuation and nested-link prevention. Intentional capacity
  and malformed-edit refusals are explicit; broader syntax and actual encrypted
  client-delivery parity remain M6 integration gates.
- Six Rust test groups pass, including 128 deterministic hostile syntax cases;
  the original bound Vitest test, Clippy, rustfmt and diff checks pass. No prior
  Cargo package version was removed or upgraded. Detailed logs are the external
  cache's `matrix-format-*` files. Task lifecycle passes all four scenarios
  plus the explicit boundary, with zero skips or uncertainty. Selector inventory
  resolves every native test binding on this isolated baseline.

## 2026-09-10 — Linux protected cgroup guardian-recovery foundation

Started from `552801b` in a separate worktree. Kernel v6.12 source inspection
confirmed that cgroup.kill is not a close-triggered Job Object equivalent and
that migration checks the control file opener's credentials. Ordinary same-UID
delegation does not provide the required private reassignment boundary. ADR-048
records exact mechanical checks, privileged host obligations and remaining gates.

The optional CgroupRecovery API consumes exact preopened host descriptors and
requires protected full-mount ancestry, an empty domain, equal nonroot UIDs,
NNP, nondumpability and zero capabilities including bounding/ambient sets. Host
SIGCHLD/reaping ownership is checked before using its retained guardian identity
for migration. The same launcher puts that guardian in the boundary before
Prepare/Start; no second workspace launcher or PID-derived kill path was added.
Channel failure or explicit stop uses retained cgroup.kill and bounded recursive
empty-population proof. Unknown outcomes retain explicit uncertainty; observed
absence of live execution is not descendant zombie reaping or canonical task done.

During this slice, the coordinator reported the unrelated macOS child heartbeat
assertion failure. Investigation and its separate fixture correction were
committed independently as `5e8c317`; they are not included in this cgroup batch.
The coordinator also confirmed actual Windows owned-IO CI passed.

The cgroup qualification executable requires explicit host-provisioned FDs and
privileges. Its real native modes cover guardian death with a double-fork detached
descendant, stream closure before stop, failed spawn and full-guarantee refusal.
Missing provisioning exits 78 without a qualification result. No system cgroup,
privileged host configuration, live model or deployment was changed. Actual
protected Linux execution and escape/reassignment fixtures remain open; local
macOS parser/refusal tests and Linux cross-compilation cannot close those gates.

Verification passed: 20 macOS platform tests and six owned-runner integration
tests; all-target Clippy with warnings denied on macOS plus Linux/Windows GNU
cross-targets; formatting and diff checks. Agent-spec 1.4 passed the two limited
scenarios and explicit 12-file boundary (3/3, quality 97%, zero fail/skip/uncertain).
These are admission/regression results, not execution of the provisioned Linux
fixture. Logs are in the operator cache under `codex-protocol/cgroup-*`.
Final source review replaced fdinfo reads with descriptor statx mount identity:
nondumpability can restrict proc fdinfo access and must not be relaxed to work
around it. Known guardian signal failures remain recorded after independent
empty-subtree proof. No push, merge or deployment was performed.

### 2026-09-10 — namespace and disposable CI cgroup qualification follow-up

Continued initial cgroup commit `33751df` in its own isolated worktree. Review
identified that mount root `/` and stat UID0 are namespace-relative. Admission
now verifies current-thread proc source entries, nsfs/type/reserved initial inode,
initial cgroup owner relation and matching nsfs mount identities. Checks repeat
after guardian exec and nondumpability reset. Source-inspected kernel release
families are 6.8/6.12/6.14; unknown versions/identities refuse. ADR-048 records
exact pinned implementation sources and privileged provisioning assumptions.

Added a GitHub-hosted Linux-only root qualifier that creates one exclusive random
cgroup subtree, passes exactly three controls to a nonroot NNP/cap-empty probe,
and retains independent bounded kill/empty observation and identity-checked
removal. Actual cases include guardian death/descendants, stop, failed spawn, full
guarantee refusal, real nested user/cgroup rejection and external cleanup after
both test custodians abort. Helpers have bounded output/deadlines and retained
pidfd cleanup. No cgroups were created or modified locally or on Mini1.

Local checks passed 21 platform tests, four Python admission/collector tests,
and all-target Clippy on macOS plus Linux/Windows GNU cross-targets. The Linux-only
ordinary-subprocess test covers pidfd finally cleanup on timeout/output overflow;
it and all privileged cgroup qualification remain pending real hosted Linux CI.
Production runner enablement, adversarial ptrace/reassignment qualification and
simultaneous-custodian-loss containment remain open. Lifecycle is recorded below.
Agent-spec 1.4 passed all three explicitly limited scenarios plus the 12-file
boundary (4/4, quality 98%, no fail/skip/uncertain). The 110 native spec bindings
were found without missing tests. Lifecycle and run logs are in the operator
cache under `codex-protocol/cgroup-qualification-*`. These results do not include
privileged Linux execution; the coordinator will integrate and run hosted CI.


### 2026-09-10 — Integrated native formatting and qualified-cgroup test path

Integrated formatter e1a7969 as 0e09783 and Linux cgroup preparation/namespace
qualification 33751df +9201ded as 73c8499 +727fdb4. Workspace members, all prior
locked package versions, existing Windows/Matrix/approval changes and concurrent
document history are preserved. An initial local conflict-resolution script
malformed Cargo files; Cargo rejected them before running tests. Reconstructed
all affected files from the parent/incoming Git snapshots, checked the complete
prior package/document sets, and amended the unpushed commit before validation.
The failure log is retained; it is not counted as passing validation.

Combined 727fdb4 passes 249 unique native tests plus one proxy-isolation child
(250 printed passes), with zero failures or ignored tests. Workspace Clippy with
warnings denied, fmt/diff and 166 native selector bindings pass. Formatter
passes 63 actual JS vectors and integrated lifecycle5/5 (16 changed paths).
Cgroup lifecycle4/4 covers the combined15 changed paths; four ordinary Python
refusal/collector tests pass on macOS. These are not privileged containment
proofs. Evidence is retained under `combined-format-cgroup-*`,
`integrated-format-*` and `integrated-cgroup-*` in the migration cache.

The next native CI push installs locked JS oracle dependencies with scripts
disabled and runs the isolated root provisioner only on a disposable hosted
Linux VM. Seven actual fault/refusal cases and retained independent subtree
cleanup must pass there. Kernel/user/cgroup namespace and delegation absence
fail qualification rather than becoming skipped proof. Root fixture cleanup
after simultaneous host/guardian loss does not upgrade the runtime's explicit
Unsupported full POSIX crash-containment guarantee. Live services remain unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 — Native MCP scoped coordination (ADR-051)

Implemented fourteen typed delegation, internal conversation, peer and graph
tools through the existing runner HTTP API. The five assigned-task tools retain
their task scope and 16 KiB request bound; coordination bodies are capped at
32 KiB. Shared response/frame/watchdog limits and host-provisioned capability
headers remain in force. Page projections reject duplicate/out-of-order cursors;
strict response DTOs omit unexpected fields and preserve opaque fractional data.
POST dependency hydration is explicitly read-only for uncertainty handling.

Real rmcp subprocess fixtures against Salvo and canonical SQLite prove exact
mutation replay, pending delegation admission, cross-project/same-Agent wrong
session rejection, membership retirement, creator control, graph readiness,
canonical Done/epoch results, and result reads. Lost graph-result and conversation
responses leave durable commits; identical reconnect retries replay while changed
content or stale authority fails. Scripted responses cover corruption, duplicate
JSON keys, excessive bodies, stalled mutation deadlines, redirects, framing and
resource/node scope mismatches. The unchanged protocol/task/CLI/watchdog suite
also passes. Host notice delivery and dispatch starts are synthetic test fixtures;
no live services or model execution were used.

Focused validation: 15 tests passed, zero failed/ignored, across the hagency lib,
MCP, task-client and new coordination targets. Clippy with warnings denied passed.
All 158 native spec selectors resolve. The task lifecycle passed all six bound
scenarios plus the explicit changed-path boundary (7/7, no fail/skip/uncertain).
Formatting and diff checks passed. Log prefix: `mcp-coordination-` in the external 2026-09-10 migration
cache. No dependency or schema changes. Discovery, file/media tools, Matrix
history, progress hooks, generated MCP configuration, runtime cutover and other
platform acceptance remain separate migration gates.


### 2026-09-10 — Qualify the hosted Linux 6.17 kernel family

At2c7b402, actual Linux native tests and all five Python helper checks passed.
The cgroup qualifier then created its isolated subtree and refused kernel
6.17.0-1022-azure because only6.8/6.12/6.14 had been source-inspected. The failure
is retained in `ci-2c7b402-linux.log`; no containment pass is claimed.

Inspected ten upstream files at Linuxv6.17 commit
e5f0a698b34ed76002dc5cff3804a61c80233a7a, cached with SHA256 manifest in
`linux-6.17-source`. Reserved inode constants now live in a UAPI header, but
initial identity/owner, dynamic range, proc task resolution, credential-bound
migration and recursive kill/fork rules preserve this adapter's assumptions.
Added6.17 to the explicit family gate and its exact observed release vector;
adjacent unqualified families remain refused. ADR048 records pinned source
links. Real hosted positive/refusal qualification still must run after this fix.

The follow-up passes two exact cgroup parser tests, Linux-target platform Clippy
with warnings denied, and lifecycle 4/4 including all four changed paths. The
integrated native inventory resolves 172 selectors. These checks establish
source eligibility and refusal behavior; they do not replace the pending actual
hosted cgroup qualification. Evidence: `cgroup-617-*` in the migration cache.

### 2026-09-10 — Integrated MCP coordination validation

Integrated 8099996 passes 256 unique native workspace tests plus the isolated
proxy child (257 printed passes), with zero failures or ignored tests. Workspace
Clippy with warnings denied passes, and all 172 native selectors resolve. The
MCP coordination lifecycle passes six scenarios plus the explicit 16-path
boundary (7/7), without fail/skip/uncertain. Logs are retained under
`combined-mcp-coordination-*` and `integrated-mcp-coordination-*` in the migration
cache. The native README now describes all 19 implemented tools and retains the
open discovery, file, history, approval and runtime-configuration boundaries.

At 2c7b402, Node CI and native macOS and Windows CI passed. Native Linux tests passed but its
actual cgroup qualifier refused the then-unqualified 6.17 kernel. The new family
check is ready for a separate real CI run. The complete native CI run remains
failed until actual Linux cgroup qualification succeeds.

## 2026-09-10 — Native transcript token normalization (ADR-055)

Added the pure hagency-metering library with explicit byte/line/record/metadata
bounds. Claude UUID deduplication and Codex last cumulative totals agree with 135
synthetic vectors executed against the retained JavaScript parser. Four token
categories remain separate; cache reads do not draw the fresh-token ceiling.
Absent usage remains unknown; malformed lines and incomplete source records stay
visible. Private workspace/model hints establish no attribution or path access.

Parallel review reproduced three gaps before integration: changed Codex cumulative
breakdowns could look consistent, missing whole usage objects escaped diagnostics,
and missing fields could hide arithmetic overflow. The fixes retain last known
components across gaps, count absent expected usage records, and independently
accumulate known Claude lower bounds. Regression fixtures cover each reproduction,
raw numeric spellings, Unicode model ordering, duplicate keys/UUID conflicts,
decreasing totals and capacity exhaustion. Five focused Rust tests and Clippy with
warnings denied pass. The preserved review probe and metering logs are in the
external migration cache. Discovery, persistent ledger, authenticated provenance,
project attribution, quota enforcement and UI integration remain open M7 work.

Final focused validation: 5/5 native tests, 135 unchanged JS oracle cases and
23/23 existing metering Vitest tests passed. All 177 native selectors resolve.
Lifecycle passed 6/6, including all 14 changed paths, with no fail/skip/uncertain.
Cargo added only the local metering package; existing versions remain pinned.

### 2026-09-10 — M6 native progress policy and scoped coalescing (ADR052)

- Added pure `hagency-progress` with fixed verbs, perGroup replacement rules,
  redacted summary DTOs and one immutable host-run accumulator. Receipt, call,
  attempt, input and counter bounds are explicit. Ordering, changed replay,
  time reversal and retired writes fail without adopting old run context.
- Progress attempts throttle before transport outcome; only the accepted frozen
  watermark retires a window. Unknown outcomes remain blocked for inspection;
  newer work and lifetime totals remain. Answer-delivery inspection is a separate
  typed host count/proof, never inferred from tool activity or progress acceptance.
- The oracle executes pure policy plus actual CLI/ACP emitter bodies using fake
  IO/clock/fetch: 275 unchanged cases and 20 documented corrections. These close
  malformed/inherited rule fallback, inherited verbs, repeated/unfiltered ACP
  failures, event-filter bypass and final summaries losing prior window totals.
  Review also found that uncompleted ACP starts looked successful at finish;
  these now remain explicit unresolved attempts. Initial completed/failed status
  is respected, with mixed-outcome and pending-notice/completion-race coverage.
- Final validation: ten focused Rust tests, the 44 original progress-filter
  Vitest tests, Clippy with warnings denied, formatting, diff and JS oracle checks
  pass. Agent-spec1.4 lifecycle passes 5/5 with zero fail/skip/uncertain and 100%
  quality; advisory output-mode/IO/grouping lint messages do not establish live
  IO coverage. All 163 native selectors bind in this isolated base. Cargo adds
  only the new workspace package and changes no prior package version.
- No legacy runtime/hook/Matrix code was edited. Evidence uses external-cache
  `progress-*` logs. This is not operational status, durable outbox, Matrix
  display or full ADR026/M6 parity; actual host attachment remains unimplemented.

### 2026-09-10 — Progress integration and regression findings

Integrated f4cdead retains the formatter, metering and prior workspace packages.
All 181 native selectors resolve; workspace Clippy and all three content/progress/
metering oracles pass. Progress lifecycle passes 5/5 with all 17 integrated paths.
The full workspace regression remains failed: native_guardian_cli_entry received
no leader-exit report within its five-second fixture wait. The archived log does
not establish whether initialization was slow or the guardian failed. A separate
agent is investigating with the existing native process contract. Evidence:
`combined-progress-metering-*` and `integrated-progress-lifecycle.*`.

At 431b2ec, native macOS and Windows CI passed. Linux failed two Matrix room
fixtures waiting for a scripted HTTP request, so cgroup qualification did not run.
The fixture used a three-second wait despite allowing a longer SDK operation
between requests; it also hid early collector errors. A separate reviewed fix
aligns the test wait with the existing budgets and reports early refusal, with
new controlled regressions. Neither failed run is reclassified as passing.


### 2026-09-10 — Matrix room fixture preserves collector diagnostics

Linux CI431b2ec failed two room tests while the scripted peer awaited a request.
Both unchanged tests pass locally. The saved Elapsed message cannot determine
whether collection was still performing SDK work or had already returned an
error. The fixture's three-second request wait was shorter than the ten-second
SDK bootstrap/mutation budget between requests. Its wait now derives from SDK
plus HTTP budgets. The two affected scripts race collector completion and report
an early error directly, instead of concealing it with a later peer timeout.
Production request, SDK and cancellation deadlines are unchanged.

The complete transport integration target passes nine tests, including a real
scripted request separated by a controlled 3.1-second SDK-sized interval and an
actual wrong-account whoami refusal that must surface Identity immediately.
Scoped rustfmt/diff and Clippy pass; ADR-047 parse/lint and the full lifecycle
pass all seven scenarios plus the explicit four-path boundary (8/8), with no
fail/skip/uncertain. Evidence is recorded in matrix-room-fixture-* under the
2026-09-10 migration cache. Fresh Linux execution remains an integration check. The first local new-test run caught a double-slash fixture
URL and was corrected before the final nine-test run. Concurrent ADR-054 intake
work remains uncommitted and is excluded from this fixture commit.

## 2026-09-10 — Host-only owned dispatch integration (ADR053)

Implemented in an isolated worktree from 727fdb4. A new hagency-execution crate
connects exact DomainStore scope to the existing owned child launcher and typed
Codex pipes. Started is durable before child effects; model/effort come from the
frozen provision effect and prompt identity/path fields remain data. Cancellation
retains one worker, owner and negative reconciliation until a private result;
unknown cleanup/replies preserve historical fencing, quarantine and leases.
Completed protocol text does not create canonical Done or Matrix replies.

Fresh macOS fixtures passed six execution tests, two store scope/fence tests,
one real writer queued/committed reply-loss test, six existing task tests and
six existing owned-pipe tests. Actual fixed native subprocesses cover protocol
completion, failed spawn, EOF, wrong thread, unsupported approvals, cancellation,
expiry/revocation and absolute deadline. The lost-receipt coordinator seam only
discards an actual committed start response and is absent in normal builds.
SQLite's existing 100 ms busy timeout stays unchanged; a lock-failure fixture
verifies explicit retained negative retry after lock release. Focused macOS and
Windows GNU all-target Clippy passed. Cross-compilation is not Windows execution;
this new coordinator's Linux/Windows CI remains pending integration.

A separate read-only reviewer found no blocker in the declared slice. ADR053
records one-thread/result bounds, the conservative 60-second library wait/join
allowance, physical-directory and sandbox gaps, commit cancellation checkpoint,
macOS partial-cleanup handling and all service enablement gates. No live model,
credential, production Matrix or cgroup change was made. Final lifecycle evidence
is recorded in the operator cache under codex-protocol/owned-dispatch-*.
Final agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle passed 10/10 (nine scenarios plus the explicit
20-file boundary), quality 94%, with no failed/skipped/uncertain scenarios.
The initial lifecycle's only failure was the known root-file path parser issue;
explicit ./Cargo.toml and ./Cargo.lock corrected it without broadening scope.
All 175 native selectors were present with zero missing bindings. Inherited
project-wide trace warnings remain separate from this bounded M4 qualification.

## 2026-09-10 — Separate guardian CLI exit from database initialization

Investigated f4cdead's combined macOS native_guardian_cli_entry failure in a new
isolated worktree. The unchanged test passed in isolation in 0.70 seconds; eight
bounded native diagnostic launches each reported LeaderExited. Those measurements
showed version exits around 25–27 ms after spawn and fresh init around 80 ms, but
do not establish the original timeout cause. No production guardian/identity or
timeout change was justified by the available evidence.

The guardian entry fixture now uses actual native --version, Unicode cwd, empty
PATH and the same guardian/Job ownership path. It retains the five-second report
limit and exact platform scope assertions, and additionally checks exact compiled
version bytes, empty stderr through EOF and stable repeated terminal observation.
Reads have 256-byte caps and two-second deadlines. The independent real-binary
crash/restart test retains fresh Unicode initialization and explicit token/domain
file assertions. Both CLI tests and macOS/Windows GNU focused Clippy passed.
The temporary measurement fixture was removed; only test/contract/ADR and these
coordination notes changed. Existing guardian lifecycle verification follows.
Final guardian agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle passed 6/6, including all five scenarios
and the five-file boundary, quality 94%, with no fail/skip/uncertain results.
Baseline, bounded diagnostics, CLI tests, both Clippy targets and lifecycle logs
are in the operator cache under guardian-cli-*. This is local macOS execution and
Windows cross-compilation; updated fixture runtime qualification still needs CI.

## 2026-09-10 — Integrated owned execution, progress and metering

At 5a734bf, the full native workspace passes 282 unique tests plus the isolated
proxy-environment child (283 printed passes), with zero failures or ignored
tests. This rerun includes the guardian CLI split and Matrix peer corrections;
earlier failed logs remain retained. All 190 native selectors resolve. Workspace
Clippy passed after execution integration, and formatting/diff checks pass.

Integrated owned-dispatch lifecycle passes 10/10 with all 20 paths, and the Matrix
fixture lifecycle passes 8/8 with all four paths. The combined execution/Matrix
targets pass 22 tests. Logs are retained under `combined-owned-progress-metering-*`,
`integrated-execution-*`, `integrated-owned-dispatch-*` and
`integrated-matrix-fixture-*`. This local result does not replace actual Linux,
Windows or cgroup qualification for the new commit. The next CI run must provide
that evidence. No live service is enabled or replaced.


### 2026-09-10 — Authenticated SDK event intake with durable domain handoff

ADR-054 adds a host-only intake plan over existing current Matrix sessions. Actual
bounded HTTPS sync feeds the owned SDK, retaining the full response and frozen
registration/account/device/room/session tickets in the encrypted SDK journal
before processing. Derived events are persisted before domain mutation. Native
admission still rechecks current shared scope atomically; no domain schema, runner
API, second task store, runtime activation, Matrix sends or live service changed.

Actual offline Olm/Megolm cross-signing and verification prove a human encrypted
DM without @, exact group mentions and thread projection. Unknown key/unverified
identity/forged sender/plaintext trust flags/media/incomplete timelines fail visibly.
Applying interruption survives restart as OutcomeUnknown with exact original raw
and targets; no replay of the SDK's already-consumed token fabricates completion.
Busy and lost domain replies retain handoff without inventing device failure.
Concurrent cancellation, negative room scope and committed-but-lost results recover
only an exact existing historical receipt. Unadmitted retired/conflicting events
remain quarantined rather than retargeted. Changed content cannot reuse a receipt.

Root review found an unchanged initial next_batch could return before persisting
cursor ownership. Fixed and tested through reopen: subsequent collect refreshes
whoami/full state but cannot consume a sync. Restore now checks actual SDK cursor,
identity, original digest and frozen targets. Real encrypted journal consistency
faults and SQLite ACK/finalization rollback are covered. Receipt capacity64 has no
eviction; observation/intake share that ceiling and production remains gated on a
future safe compaction lifecycle. New SDK proof DTOs remain private; public status
exposes only phase/digest/counts. Live publication/query/verification of keys,
automatic Applying/quarantine recovery, history/media and native cutover are open.

Final local checks: complete Matrix package30 tests and verified-ingress target14
pass (44 distinct tests, no ignored/failures), Clippy for Matrix/store all targets
with warnings denied, fmt/diff and172 native bindings pass. Earlier development
failures included fixture API signatures, a valid negative-room generation,
required media fields, SDK signature-upload acknowledgement, and duplicate test
module imports; they were corrected rather than reclassified as passing. Logs
are matrix-intake-* in the 2026-09-10 migration cache. The scoped six-scenario
contract lifecycle and fourteen-path boundary are recorded separately below.

Agent-spec1.4 final lifecycle passes all six ADR-054 scenarios plus the explicit
fourteen-path boundary (7/7, quality100%, no fail/skip/uncertain). Exact run logs
are retained in matrix-intake-lifecycle/ and matrix-intake-lifecycle.log. These
local fixture results do not claim hosted Linux/Windows or live Matrix behavior;
the coordinator will run the integrated checks after the isolated commit.


### 2026-09-10 — M6 native Codex progress attachment (ADR056)

- Added `hagency-progress-runtime`, private-constructor runtime source/receipt
  types and opt-in driver/owned reads. Exact instance/thread/turn and contiguous
  receipts fence foreign, skipped, stale and retired observations. Default Update,
  launch, approval and process cleanup behavior stays available to existing callers.
- Typed tool policy entry shares ACP call tracking without synthesizing ACP JSON.
  Command completion requires explicit completed status and exitCode0; failed and
  unresolved attempts stay separate. File-change evidence is upstream-only.
  Contradicting final snapshots retire the optional projection. Unsupported tool
  kinds remain counted only in fixed diagnostics; no raw payload reaches text.
- Borrowed read cancellation and external active-source close/drop retain the
  runtime/process owner and historical local attempt custody. No Matrix send,
  domain write, canonical task completion or answer-delivery inference was added.
- Focused validation: 66 tests passed across progress, progress-runtime and runtime,
  including two real offline native subprocess cases, plus all 275 unchanged JS
  progress vectors and 20 explicit correction vectors. Focused Clippy with warnings
  denied and formatting pass. Full lifecycle/binding results are recorded below.
- This closes only the typed Codex observation-to-policy seam. Current domain
  authority attachment, durable status custody, private Matrix routing/encryption
  and actual sends remain open. Tests use no model or service. Evidence is stored
  in the external migration cache under `progress-attachment-*`.

Final ADR056 checks: agent-spec1.4 lifecycle passes 6/6 including changed-file
boundaries, with zero failed/skipped/uncertain/pending-review scenarios. All186
native selectors resolve in this isolated base. Advisory lint output does not
establish live adapter or transport coverage. Existing pinned package versions
are unchanged. The repository has no provisioned task-writer in this checkout;
this task contract and external lifecycle logs record the bounded migration work,
not a claim of canonical service-task mutation or production enablement.

Final self-review closed a clock edge: ignored and gated runtime notifications now
advance the same host clock as claims/settlement, without inventing a tool event
or policy receipt. Backdated new claims and settlements cannot bypass a later
quiet event; exact historical settlement replay remains idempotent. The added
actual-stream regression passes with the complete affected66-test suite.

## 2026-09-10 — Integrate authenticated intake and native progress attachment

Integrated Matrix63cbbae as9deb056 and progress7d828b5 as7cdeba6, retaining both
branches' coordination history, all Cargo members and every prior dependency
version. Matrix/verified-ingress44 and progress/runtime66 affected tests pass.
Matrix lifecycle passes7/7 with all14 paths; progress attachment passes6/6 with
all21 paths. Workspace Clippy, formatting,275+20 progress oracle cases and all
201 selector bindings pass. Full integrated native regression passes309 unique
tests plus the isolated proxy child (310 printed), zero failed or ignored.
Evidence is retained in integrated-matrix-intake-*, integrated-progress-attachment-*,
integrated-intake-progress-bindings.* and combined-intake-progress-tests.log.

The completed ae284b9 CI is not green. Node34529853146 and native macOS pass.
Linux's whole workspace passes and actual cgroup cases guardian-death, stop,
failed-spawn and guarantee-refused qualify on6.17.0-1022-azure. Nested-user then
fails exec126 with Permission denied before native admission. No later case is
counted as run. The strict namespace result remains required; a separate agent
is implementing a fixture staging correction without changing runtime checks.

Windows job103047645091 fails six Matrix and twelve Palpo transport tests, plus
the nested proxy child. Explicit OutcomeUnknown appears at writer responses and
several scripts then wait for a request that never arrives. Logs do not establish
the cause or distinguish disk pressure from another worker problem. The pipeline
now runs the unchanged two transport targets with one test thread only after a
Windows full-suite failure. This bounded eight-minute diagnostic preserves the
original failed verdict; it changes no deadlines, correctness assertions or
production concurrency. Its actual Windows outcome is pending the next CI run.
Logs ci-ae284b9-linux.log and ci-ae284b9-windows.log retain both failures.

MCP launch and native file snapshots remain in independent worktrees. In particular,
a successful canonical Done can invalidate the current owned execution epoch
before a final answer is emitted. The unchanged fence remains; read-only reporting
after completion needs its own integration. No production service is enabled.
## 2026-09-10 — Native owned task MCP launch (ADR-057)

- Added typed host-generated Codex task MCP configuration using pinned 0.153.4 source semantics. The exact owned task/capability becomes private child environment; config carries only names and fixed native helper args/tools. Default on-request, workspace-write and network-disabled settings remain unchanged.
- Real owned native pipes now exercise the actual `hagency mcp` helper against a fresh local canonical writer. Heartbeat requires response, readback and successful helper exit. Frozen model input containing foreign task/cwd/model values cannot replace host scope; actual capability is absent from captured config, prompt, receipt and report text.
- The Done fixture exposed a real race: epoch revocation can stop the old runtime before helper acknowledgement/readback/exit. Acceptance now requires durable Done, LostAuthority/Unknown, exact negative fence and a retained dirty lease, while separate atomic stage receipts distinguish observed from unknown delivery. Both completed and interrupted helper stages were observed during development. Renewal and the epoch fingerprint are unchanged; a later reporting phase is still required before the user reply workflow is operational.
- macOS actual pipe/MCP/writer checks pass. The existing macOS whole-tree uncertainty remains fenced; Windows cross-Clippy is compile evidence only. Current focused checks: 51 runtime/execution tests, 6 existing task-client/MCP tests, 3 new integration tests (60 unique); native and Windows GNU Clippy with warnings denied; 194 Rust spec bindings. Scoped agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle passed 5/5 (four scenarios plus the 12-file boundary), with no fail/skip/uncertain result; logs are in the local migration evidence cache.
- No live Codex model, deployed service, production credential, schema change, Matrix reply or runner availability toggle. Protected executable/workspace/config-home provisioning and effective sandbox/tool-inventory qualification remain gates.

## 2026-09-10 — Bounded native workspace file snapshots

ADR-058 adds `hagency-files`: host-opened directory authority, strict portable
relative selections, retained component/file handles, immutable bounded byte
copies and SHA256, plus shared snapshot-count custody through Drop. Real fixtures
cover Unicode, hardlinks, symlinks/FIFO, root/ancestor/leaf replacement, mutation
during copying, size limits and concurrent capacity. The Windows fixture creates
actual symlinks and a junction and refuses unsupported prerequisites visibly.
CONIN$/CONOUT$ and other DOS aliases are rejected portably. A same-size overwrite
with restored modification time documents why copied bytes are not an atomic
source-version guarantee.

All 11 focused tests pass on local macOS. Clippy passes for native macOS and
cross-target Windows GNU/Linux GNU. The first local fixture compilation exposed
an unavailable Apple `rustix::mkfifoat`; the test now creates its real FIFO using
a bounded fixed command. No production command API was added. All 412 pre-existing
locked package identities are unchanged; 12 additions include the new crate and
pinned cap-std/cap-fs-ext/cap-primitives 4.0.3 dependency chain. Logs are under the
operator cache's `file-snapshot-*` prefix. Actual Windows/Linux execution still
requires CI; this slice does not claim protected physical workspace provisioning,
atomic source consistency, persistent staging, live service wiring or Matrix media.

Task lifecycle passes 6/6: five exact native selectors and all 11 explicit changed
paths, with zero failures, skips or uncertain results. It runs against the new
crate directory to avoid rebuilding unrelated workspace packages. Full workspace
binding enumeration hit host disk exhaustion; its failure log is retained, and a
subsequent reduced-artifact attempt was stopped for coordinated cleanup. Only this
worktree's generated target was cleaned. Combined binding verification is pending
on the root integration target; neither interrupted run counts as passing.

### 2026-09-10 — Linux hosted qualifier binary staging follow-up (ADR048)

- ae284b9's Linux log passed four native cases, then unshare could not exec the
  nested-user probe (126/Permission denied). Historical ancestor modes were not
  recorded; they are not asserted as observed fact. Added an independent fresh
  fixture-UID0700 ancestor reproduction before the mandatory native78 case.
- The helper stages two fixed bounded probes in a retained root-owned sealed
  directory under fixed/tmp. Original source/checkout permissions are preserved;
  exact descriptor/inode cleanup refuses changed files/directories. No runtime
  namespace policy, privilege requirement or qualification exit is relaxed.
- Eleven local ordinary-file Python tests pass, including actual compiled native
  execution, copy/mode preservation, byte/type/symlink/refusal bounds, source
  growth, partial write cleanup, replacement survival and strict126 classification.
  Local tests do not execute a privileged namespace or qualify Linux containment.
- Evidence lives under external-cache `ci-staging-*`. Cargo-bound native lifecycle
  and hosted seven-case results are separate; hosted qualification remains pending
  until the coordinator integrates and runs the workflow. An early local fixture
  copied Apple's platform-signed echo and was killed by AMFI; a tiny fixed compiled
  program supplies the portable native-copy fixture without changing code policy.

Final checks: Python11/11, syntax and diff checks pass. Agent-spec1.4 lifecycle
passes4/4: the three unchanged native admission/refusal scenarios plus all six
changed-file boundaries, with zero fail/skip/uncertain. This does not substitute
for the separately run Python suite or pending hosted namespace qualification.
The first lifecycle attempt exited during local disk exhaustion with no usable
result; only generated targets from completed worktrees were cleaned, and the
successful rerun is separately recorded. No source/log deletion, full binding
inventory, local privileged invocation or deployment/push was performed.

## 2026-09-10 — MCP, file snapshot and hosted fixture integration

Integrated ADR057 as949b5d9, ADR058 as213342b and hosted binary staging asb42ff9b.
Every prior locked dependency identity remains present. Only generated Cargo
targets from completed isolated worktrees were cleaned after disk exhaustion;
source trees, commits and failure evidence remain intact.

At b42ff9b, the complete native workspace passes324 unique tests plus the isolated
proxy-environment child (325 printed), with zero failed or ignored. All210 native
selector bindings resolve. Focused file11, owned-MCP3 and runtime/execution/
progress-runtime61 tests pass, as do Python staging11, workspace Clippy with
warnings denied, formatting and diff checks. Integrated lifecycle results are
files6/6 with11 changed paths, MCP5/5 with12 paths and CI staging4/4 with6 paths;
no fail/skip/uncertain result is counted as passing. Broader requirement-trace
diagnostics remain distinct from these bounded contracts. Evidence is retained
under integrated-files-*, integrated-owned-mcp-*, integrated-mcp-progress-*,
integrated-ci-staging-*, combined-files-mcp-staging-tests.log and
integrated-files-mcp-bindings.* in the local migration cache.

The preceding88534b0 native run34531716943 is complete: Windows and macOS pass;
Linux passes the whole workspace but fails hosted nested-user execution with
exit126/Permission denied before native admission. Its newly integrated staging
correction still requires a new hosted run. Windows's default full test step
passes in187 seconds, so the failure-only serial diagnostic is correctly skipped.
This is not a serial/default comparison or proof of the earlier timeout cause.
Both Palpo code and transport tests are unchanged between those failing/passing
runs; Matrix intake code changed. Local writer/custody response timing remains
the first measurement target if failures recur, without widening deadlines.

Node run34531716948 fails one existing service-supervisor test: its healthy-state
assertions pass, then waiting for exactly four child event rows times out after
3000ms. The other4283 tests pass and one is skipped. No root cause is established
from that log; a separate clean worktree is investigating the actual fixture and
supervisor evidence. The failed log is retained and no assertion is relaxed.

ADR059 actual Matrix sender and ADR060 atomic completion with held reply custody
are being implemented in separate worktrees. The current native service still
does not launch Agents, send Matrix messages or replace the deployed application.

## 2026-09-10 — Bounded attachment crypto (ADR061)

Added a host-only hagency-media codec on the pinned Matrix SDK0.18 attachment
primitive and retained workspace snapshots. Encrypted results keep the original
snapshot/file permits, immutable ciphertext and private encryption metadata;
checked decryption validates the complete bounded ciphertext and SDK EOF before
returning plaintext. Static errors and opaque data types keep secrets out of
automatic projections. Size/count admission covers concurrent cloned owners.

Four focused native tests pass, including eight fixed independent Node AES
vectors verified by the actual existing Matrix crypto binding, real retained
files, SDK round trips, malformed/duplicate metadata, corruption/truncation,
capacity and concurrent custody. A regression deliberately demonstrates that
a changed valid key with the same ciphertext hash can produce different bytes:
descriptor provenance must still come from an authenticated encrypted event.
This primitive does not claim sender identity, durable staging or file delivery.

Focused Clippy and formatting pass; the only new locked package identity is
hagency-media. Independent review caught that the Rust CI job disables native
addon install scripts, so the actual Node crypto oracle now runs in the existing
Node test job after its normal npm ci. The Rust jobs consume those checked
fixtures without enabling postinstall scripts. Fresh CI qualification and the
bounded contract lifecycle remain separate from this local evidence.

The preceding79b036c Linux job103059541895 now passes the whole native workspace,
all12 ordinary staging tests and all seven actual cgroup cases on6.17.0-1022-azure:
guardian-death, stop, failed-spawn, guarantee-refused, nested-user, nested-cgroup
and custodians-abort. Every subtree was independently observed empty. This closes
the hosted probe-execution blocker; it does not establish complete simultaneous
backend/guardian crash containment or enable a production runner. The full log
is retained as ci-79b036c-linux.log.

ADR061 final local contract lifecycle passes5/5, including all13 explicit changed
paths, with no fail/skip/uncertain. Descriptor boundary tests include a valid
1024-byte input, its refused1025-byte extension, duplicate fields and padded or
noncanonical base64. Independent review found no further code blocker after the
CI oracle correction. The16 MiB maximum is a deliberate bounded subset of the
legacy20 MiB surface; this does not claim full file-feature parity.
### 2026-09-10 — Legacy supervisor fixture port custody and diagnostics

The original 88534b0 Node failure passed health assertions, then timed out waiting
for exactly four event rows. Its log omitted rows/ports/restarts, so the cause
cannot be assigned retrospectively. Unmodified local supervisor tests pass 8/8.
A controlled real-child same-port run reports healthy at 236 ms but yields only
three ready events, six dashboard restarts and EADDRINUSE after 3237 ms. This proves
the fixture's independently released ephemeral ports were allowed to collide.

The isolated test-only fix keeps both listeners reserved until selection ends
and closes both in finally, including callback failure. Four added regressions
exercise actual bind conflicts/release, real extra stopped events remaining a
failure and bounded redaction. Startup still requires exactly four rows within
3000 ms. Production service code, lease duration, probes and deployments remain
unchanged. The expanded focused file passes 12/12 in 4.12 s; preserved logs use the
external cache's node-supervisor prefix. Parse/lint quality is 100%, all five
scenario bindings exist, and syntax/diff checks pass. Native lifecycle remains
non-passing: despite its requested lint/boundary layers it launched Cargo for a
Node selector and was stopped; the Node-directory attempt then reported missing
Cargo execution. Neither is a passing boundary or behavioral result. Only the
owned generated target is cleaned; source and all original logs are preserved.
## 2026-09-10 — Native final-reply send checkpoints (ADR-033 amendment)

- Added host-only claimed preview and current Sending validation, so the native Matrix sender can match its private transport account before send-start and recheck exact current scope before IO. Neither method performs network IO or changes reply state.
- A journaled exact Delivered observation can now reconcile Sending directly after sender receipt/secret loss. NotSent remains Uncertain-only; immutable body/route, send fence and durable inspection digest still determine acceptance and replay. No runner endpoints or native schema changes.
- Focused reply repository suite covers wrong secrets/fences/IDs, expiry, null-root DM promotion, substituted delivery fields, NotSent refusal and exact positive replay. All 16 focused reply tests and Store Clippy passed. The scoped agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle passed 3/3 with no failed/skipped/uncertain scenarios using the store package as its code root; ADR059 owns actual Matrix sender consumption separately.

## 2026-09-10 — Windows file-custody qualification correction

Native79b036c run34533485134 finishes failed on Windows while Linux and macOS pass;
Node34533485274 passes. Two Windows file tests incorrectly require a retained
directory to be renamed. Actual error32 and the pinned cap-primitives4.0.3
oflags/dir_utils source agree: directory opens deliberately exclude SHARE_DELETE.
The corrected Windows fixtures require that exact denial, verify original bytes
and retained snapshot custody, then release the handles and require the same
rename to succeed. POSIX still exercises actual ancestor/root replacement; the
leaf-file case remains a real rename. Production handle flags are unchanged.
New actual Windows execution remains required; local/cross checks cannot supply it.

The same run has four unrelated DomainStore shutdown OutcomeUnknown failures
(three MCP coordination cases and one runner HTTP case). Their assertions reach
shutdown after their functional checks, at fixture.rs216 and runner.rs183.
The failure-only diagnostic's Matrix9 and Palpo13 transport targets pass serially;
this does not diagnose those different shutdown failures. Logs are retained as
ci-79b036c-windows.log. No shutdown deadline, retry or final-release claim is changed.
### Native owned completion handoff (ADR-060 / schema 016)

Implemented explicit canonical Done plus held final text through the real native
MCP/HTTP boundary. Exact historical receipt replay is isolated from ordinary runner
commands. The retained owned runner stops before final admission; no protocol text
or epoch refresh grants execution, marks Done, or releases unrelated custody.
The writer checks cancellation after queue/lock and rechecks original route,
completed epoch, attempt and finite deadline before publishing stored content.

Focused evidence: the complete store package passed 115 tests; runtime/execution
regressions passed 51; native MCP/task-client tests passed 13. Actual local native
helper finish commits Done and preserves the macOS whole-tree refusal gate. The
new MCP endpoint rejects foreign task/route/capability, conflicting replay and
oversized encoded input; identical post-fence replay returns only its receipt.
Capacity, migration, queue reply loss, cancellation and wrong-scope/route/resource
fixtures retain canonical and custody invariants. Native and cross-target checks
and both focused task lifecycles are recorded with this slice's validation.

Native service remains disabled. Actual Linux/Windows positive completion cleanup
and the complete authenticated Matrix input-to-final-send workflow require the
combined platform integration/CI; ADR-059 owns the final Matrix sender. Task-only
Done and ownerless held content still require an explicit future reporting or
inspection path rather than automatic re-execution.

Final scoped validation: 195 tests across the selected packages and native helper
integration targets (16 core, 115 store, 51 runtime/execution, 13 helper/client).
Native and Windows GNU cross-target all-target Clippy pass with warnings denied;
fmt/diff checks pass. Agent-spec 1.4 package-scoped lifecycles pass all 8 store
scenarios and 3 native integration scenarios plus both boundaries, quality 100%,
with zero fail/skip/uncertain. Cross-compilation is not Windows runtime evidence.
## 2026-09-10 — Bounded shutdown phase diagnostics

- Preserved the original Windows 79b036c MCP/runner teardown failures. Source
  inspection cannot assign them to queueing, SQLite destruction or scheduling.
  Added optional per-job fixed atomic timestamps and an original-verdict snapshot;
  no deadline, retry, Drop-before-ack, ordinary shutdown or authority change.
- Four focused selectors passed: actual normal ownership release, enqueue versus
  queued reply timeout, controlled Drop/ack phase pauses, and independently
  published bounded snapshots. The initial private tests ran in 4.22 seconds and
  actual repository success fixture in 0.13 seconds. Added explicit zero-time and
  partial-order checks; root review corrected a test race where a second shutdown
  can observe either enqueue-closed or reply-closed after the first acknowledgement.
- MCP/runner fixture shutdown still fails on the original error and prints only
  that error plus the static snapshot. Success remains silent. Focused Store
  Clippy and scoped agent-spec lifecycle pass; the lifecycle includes four bound
  behaviors plus boundary with no failures, skips or uncertainty. Validation logs
  are external under the shutdown prefix. No full workspace rebuild was run;
  affected MCP/runner suites and Windows qualification belong to integration.
## 2026-09-10 — Native authenticated Matrix outgoing custody

ADR059 adds actual bounded authenticated notice/final sending to the owned
Matrix collector, consuming the separately tested ADR033 host send checkpoints.
The protected outgoing journal preserves original route/fence/formatted bytes,
SDK key-share/ciphertext writes and accepted HTTP responses. Domain Sending
precedes key sharing; fresh identity/full-state/recipient checks and current
claim validation gate each write, including after the awaited Possible marker.
No claim secret is persisted and uncertain bytes are never automatically resent.

Real local HTTPS fixtures cover plaintext formatted notices/finals and encrypted
DM/group delivery with strict SDK decryption and new group sessions. Additional
faults cover malformed fresh cross-signing/device keys despite cached trust,
retirement during journal persistence, lost HTTP/SDK/domain replies, SQLite
rollback, late retired notice acceptance, nine corrupted protected history
shapes on reopen and 64 actual sends followed by capacity refusal without eviction.
Only exact current notice acceptance activates its task; historical acceptance
records delivery without restoring authority.

The complete Matrix package passes 49 tests (40 unit including 19 outgoing, plus
9 transport), with zero failed/ignored tests. Native package Clippy with warnings
denied passes after correcting two collapsible conditions and boxing the private
notice Source variant. Cargo.lock changes only the existing package's local
formatting/SHA dependency metadata; no locked version changes. Earlier compile,
fixture and Clippy failure logs remain under the external evidence cache's
matrix-outgoing-* prefix. Full workspace/three-platform integration is reserved
for the coordinator; no duplicate broad isolated build or live service ran.

The existing notice/store regression suite passes 14/14. Agent-spec 1.4
lifecycle passes 7/7: six exact selectors and all 18 explicit changed paths,
with zero failures, skips, pending reviews or uncertain results. Live key upload,
missing-session claims, trust establishment, automatic uncertain-send recovery,
receipt compaction, media, production wiring and overall M5 completion remain
explicit gates. No native availability toggle, domain migration or deployment.

ADR-060 review closure: pass the original operation Instant into queued publication
and check it together with cancellation after writer queue/DB lock acquisition.
The new actual queued-expiry test preserves held body/lease even when the separate
persisted completion deadline is later. Three completion worker tests and five
actual helper/MCP tests pass, as does native all-target Clippy. Documentation now
distinguishes decoded body32KiB, native MCP/client encoded32KiB, and direct private
HTTP encoded64KiB limits; no handler or permission limit was relaxed.

## 2026-09-10 — Offline authenticated Matrix to owned native completion

ADR062 adds one test-only integration harness over real local TLS, the owned SDK
collector, canonical DomainStore, normal notice activation/inbox dispatch, actual
owned native app-server pipes, generated native MCP helper and final sender. The
original human event/thread, exact body and separate notice acceptance are checked
throughout. Native Done and upstream unknown output remain distinct; final
publication uses only retained actual owner cleanup and the existing writer fence.

First local run passed all three tests in1.82s. On macOS the positive process flow
commits Done but correctly requires CleanupUnknown, a retained lease and no final
HTTP. Real notice403/lost responses prevent activation and execution; forged
plaintext verification in an encrypted DM is refused before task creation and
currently retires the entire transport. Per-event refusal without disabling
unrelated chat is a separate production follow-up. The Linux/Windows branches require actual final HTTPS, formatted body/original root
and idempotent accepted receipt, pending actual platform CI. No production source,
schema, permission, service availability or live deployment change was made.

Final ADR062 focused validation: three integration tests pass, including exact
HTTP room/transaction paths. Native and Windows GNU cross-target Clippy for the
new integration target pass with warnings denied; fmt/diff checks pass. The
agent-spec1.4 package lifecycle passes4/4 (three scenarios plus all eight explicit
changed paths), quality100%, zero fail/skip/uncertain. Evidence is retained under
the external cache's matrix-owned prefix. Windows cross-compilation is not actual
Windows execution; Linux/Windows final delivery remains for integrated native CI.


## 2026-09-10 — Integrated completion and Matrix delivery checkpoint

Integrated ADR059 authenticated outgoing custody, ADR060 explicit held completion
and its queued-publication deadline correction, shutdown phase diagnostics, and
ADR062 actual local TLS/owned native MCP workflow. The original operation deadline
is checked after the publication writer queue and SQLite lock, so a persisted
completion deadline cannot extend the operation's authority.

The first combined suite found one strict MCP catalog regression: the expected
catalog lacked the newly implemented complete_task_with_reply tool. The expected
catalog now contains all twenty names; schema and negative authority assertions
remain intact. The original failure log is retained as
combined-completion-matrix-tests.log in the external migration evidence cache.
The focused catalog lifecycle passes 7/7 including its explicit changed path.

After that correction, the entire locked native workspace passes 367 unique tests
(368 printed results because the environment-proxy test also runs its child),
78 suites and zero failures or ignored tests. All 243 specification selectors
resolve to actual tests. Workspace all-target Clippy with warnings denied,
rustfmt and diff checks pass. Evidence uses the
combined-completion-matrix-workflow-tests and integrated-completion-matrix-workflow
prefixes. Integrated scoped lifecycles pass for the completion store (9/9),
completion integration (4/4), shutdown diagnostics (5/5), Matrix outgoing (7/7),
queued-deadline store correction (10/10) and MCP correction (4/4), each with all
explicit paths checked and no failed, skipped or uncertain verdicts.

The previous pushed revision 75f47f1 passed actual Linux, macOS and Windows native
CI (34535368811), including Windows retained-root/ancestor handles and media
fixtures. Its Node CI (34535368595) passed 4,288 tests with one existing skip,
including eight native-addon media oracle vectors. Those results qualify that
revision only. New ADR059/060/062 Linux and Windows execution remains a CI gate;
local macOS deliberately retains unknown cleanup and sends no final reply.
Historical Windows shutdown failures still have no established cause.

Three isolated agents continue the usage ledger, private Matrix approval intake
and durable per-event intake refusal. No live services, accounts, credentials,
model execution, release availability or production cutover were changed. This
checkpoint does not complete any migration milestone or the overall migration.

Final checkpoint lifecycle checks pass: ADR062 integration4/4 with all eight
changed paths, ADR056 reference correction6/6 using the workspace code root, and
the coordination/readme checkpoint10/10 with all four explicit paths. The earlier
package-only ADR056 invocation remains recorded as5pass/1skip; it is not counted
as passing. No production code changed after the combined native suite.

## 2026-09-10 — Native host-attributed usage ledger

ADR063/schema017 adds host-only binding and recording for one exact Started native
dispatch/fence. The existing bounded parser creates non-deserializable normalized
observations; raw paths/models never select an Agent. Immutable historical source
identity survives retirement/restart and no live scan, runtime source setter,
provider authentication claim, service hookup or quota authority is introduced.

Per-kind observed high-water growth, UTC daily/monthly buckets, original content-
bound receipts and the checked writer clock commit in one SQLite transaction.
Unknown fields and full parser diagnostics remain visible separately from known
lower bounds. Latest incomplete/regression flags cover cross-snapshot decreases;
historical incomplete coverage stays sticky. Finite source/receipt/period limits
refuse admission without evicting prior evidence. Both period inserts roll back
when a new month needs two rows but only one remains.

The JavaScript oracle produces 16 vectors/80 snapshots against the retained ledger
for known-count high-water, cache separation and observed UTC arithmetic. Native
correction fixtures cover unknown/zero, malformed and duplicate evidence, overflow,
clock reversal, all six row ceilings, foreign and retired source bindings,
reappearance and actual database rollback. Real writer fixtures qualify timestamp
after SQLite lock and before/after-commit response loss without wider deadlines.

Validation before final lifecycle: 133 affected tests passed (128 store, 5 parser),
zero failed/ignored; focused warnings-denied Clippy passed. The first focused run
was 6 passed/1 failed because the fixture used an unqualified Claude model alias;
it now uses the existing qualified `claude-sonnet-5` resource without changing
qualification policy. The initial compile had one temporary-borrow scope error,
fixed by computing queue weight before moving the opaque scope. Those logs remain
in the external `usage-*` cache. Full workspace/three-platform integration is
reserved for the coordinator; source discovery, actual descriptor/process matching,
automatic archival/retention, enforcement and browser/service integration remain
explicit gates.

Final scoped verification: latest correction/capacity assertions pass 7/7, and
agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle passes 9/9 (eight bound selectors, including two real
writer tests, plus all 30 explicit changed paths), with zero failed/skipped/
uncertain/pending-review results. One nonblocking lint heuristic requests file-
output coverage for persistence wording; this slice has no CLI/file formatter.
The first lifecycle correctly failed only because bare `Cargo.lock` was not
recognized as a root path; the contract now declares `./Cargo.lock`. That failure
log is preserved. Final oracle, formatting and whitespace checks pass. Parent
independent review checked source authority, optional arithmetic, latest flags,
all six capacity branches and second-period rollback with no remaining blocker.
No source tests or production deadlines were weakened.


## 2026-09-10 — Operator usage observation projection (ADR067)

Added one authenticated native GET for engagement aggregate usage and selected
UTC day/month observations. One original bounded writer operation reads the
projection; no source restoration or observation write is exposed. Unknown data
and absent periods remain null, incomplete/regression history stays explicit,
and private task/source/workspace/room records never enter the response type.
The capability describes a development read endpoint only; execution, connected
transport, browser console and production parity remain disabled.

Three real Salvo/fresh-writer tests pass, exercising authority and forbidden
headers, absent/partial/regressed/recovered observations, exact public fields,
malformed/duplicate/oversized/out-of-range queries, missing engagements and
missing/closed writers. Focused native Clippy with warnings denied passes. Initial
compile evidence (Salvo generated handler name collided with a pattern binding)
and fixture failure (task/session arguments swapped) are preserved under the
external usage-read prefix; both were corrected without changing production
authority or weakening assertions. Root independently integrated ADR063 schema17
and its lifecycle passes9/9 with all30 paths; its16 JavaScript vectors also pass.

ADR067 strict lifecycle passes4/4 with all15 changed paths. Independent review
found no blocker. The final three tests also cover both supported UTC endpoints
and a percent-encoded duplicate parameter; all pass, with formatting and diff
checks clean. Existing locked package versions remain unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 — Conclusive native Matrix event rejection

ADR065 adds private bounded source dispositions after exact raw-to-actual-SDK
coverage, before any eligible event admission. Rejected and non-target source
tombstones survive cursor completion and cannot be reinterpreted under new plans
or key/trust updates. Genuine identity/room negatives, incomplete timelines, SDK
uncertainty and domain authority failures retain their existing fences. No schema
or service change; ADR064 approval journals remain a separate collector purpose.

Nine focused fixtures first passed in 8.13s: actual mixed bad/good chat, encrypted private
missing-key and trust-change continuation, replay after SDK restart/new plan,
real SQLite receipt rollback, SDK interruption, missing coverage, identity failure,
legacy filtered-history inspection, corruption of candidate/source/phase fields
and real terminal receipts through capacity. Early failures exposed fixture
misuse of Collector.close (correctly retires transport), incomplete key query
responses and SDK cached unverified group-session sender data. Tests now cycle
only the actual SDK owner and use a freshly shared ordinary human outbound group
key for the newly sent message after verification; old receiver state/proofs are
never reset. Temporary diagnostics were removed. The original failure logs remain
in the external matrix-rejection evidence files.

Final local validation: 58 Matrix tests and three amended owned-workflow tests
pass; the nine new tests pass again after unsigned-metadata and missing-ID replay
vectors were added. Native and Windows GNU cross-target Clippy pass with warnings
denied; cross-compilation is not Windows execution. agent-spec 1.4 passes the new
contract 6/6 (five scenarios and the complete 14-path boundary), quality 100%,
with zero fail, skip or uncertain. Evidence uses the matrix-rejection prefix in
the external cache; full integrated OS qualification remains with the parent.
The amended ADR062 contract separately passes 4/4 (three scenarios and its five
changed paths), quality 100%, with zero fail, skip or uncertain.

### 2026-09-10 — ADR064 native private Matrix approval intake

An isolated approval collector now uses actual bounded HTTPS and the owned SDK to
settle existing native owner requests. Its purpose-bound encrypted journal and
cursor cannot be adopted by Agent chat or outgoing transport. Exact registered
bot/whoami and full private owner membership precede frozen native target intake;
verified cross-signed encrypted structured actions feed a transactional current
request/binding/dispatch/task/resource check. Negative approval evidence retires
old shared bindings and grants without rotating the Agent transport.

Every timeline source, including ordinary or refused messages, retains an immutable
wire tombstone. Separate SDK proof and ciphertext digests bind domain receipts.
Changed-source replay quarantines; a new target plan cannot reinterpret an old
rejection. Applying interruptions stay inspectable with the original response
and exact cursor. Lost domain responses and actual SDK SQLite rollback recover
only historical accepted receipts, even after private-device rotation, and cannot
mint new grants. Finite 64-batch/256-source limits reject capacity without eviction.

Local full Matrix verification passes 65 tests (56 unit, including 16 new approval
fixtures, plus 9 transport tests), with zero failures or ignored tests. The 16 store
approval tests pass, including new scope/expiry, stale-negative CAS and grant/source
transaction rollback checks. Clippy with warnings denied passes after one initial
collapsible-if correction; formatting and the task contract parse/lint pass. All
failed compile/fixture/lint logs remain in the external matrix-approval-* evidence
cache. No lockfile version, schema, live account, service or deployment changed.
Agent-spec 1.4 lifecycle passes 6/6, including five exact selectors and all 20
explicit changed paths; no failed, skipped, uncertain or pending-review result.

Native IDs remain approval_ plus 40 hex characters; legacy Robrix/JavaScript uses
32. Card delivery/client compatibility, runtime decision application, live key
provisioning, automatic unknown-SDK recovery, receipt compaction and service cutover
are explicit gates. Parent integration and three-platform CI remain separate from
these actual local tests. The existing outgoing target was reused to avoid another
large SDK build tree; no broad workspace build ran in this isolated worktree.

## 2026-09-10 — Bounded native private media staging

ADR066 adds isolated hagency-media-store storage over actual Snapshot/Encrypted/
CheckedBytes custody. Stable operation IDs bind exact bytes, kind, namespace and
private descriptors in a finite checksummed journal. Retained directory/file
capabilities, one file owner, strict private checks and creation-only Windows SID/
DACL sealing precede private writes. No domain schema, Matrix path or service API
changed; staging does not grant execution, route or delivery authority.

Real interruption fixtures cover intent, partial payload, descriptor, commit and
sync/response boundaries. Unknown tails remain quarantined without truncation;
complete committed frames recover original ciphertext/keys. Actual refused OS
write with zero persisted bytes demonstrates restart absence, not unsent proof.
A future domain operation must be persisted before invoking staging. Parent review
found preflight Media ownership loss; StageFailure now returns unadmitted input
while post-write failures stay held by the original Store, with exact descriptor
regressions for conflict, full/quarantined state and failed private-object checks.

Latest affected local tests pass 23/23 (11 files, 4 codec, 7 staging, 1 existing
private-storage regression). Native and Windows GNU warnings-denied Clippy pass,
including Windows sealing/ACL fixture compilation. Actual Windows runtime/three-
platform qualification is delegated to integrated CI. A first compile needed an
explicit result type; the ownership API refactor briefly left the public signature
unchanged and failed compilation, then was corrected without changing behavior
assertions. Initial unused test imports were removed. All earlier failure logs
remain in the external media-staging-* evidence cache. No full workspace build,
live service, automatic cleanup, hardware power-loss or native cutover claim.

Final agent-spec 1.4 strict lifecycle passes 7/7: six bound selectors (seven
actual staging tests) plus the boundary check for all 13 changed paths, with no
failed, skipped, uncertain or pending-review results. Four nonblocking lint
heuristics remain: two request absence/API constraint coverage and two do not
recognize the explicit local-filesystem verification metadata. These are not
claimed as additional test passes. Added real upstream snapshot-permit assertions
prove returned and retained failure custody also keeps the original resource
owner alive. The final replay selector passes 2/2; both Clippy targets, formatting
and whitespace checks pass after those assertions. All evidence is retained under
the external media-staging-final-* cache logs.

## 2026-09-10 — Windows approval cancellation fixture phase

Retrieved the completed c0afefc Windows job 103078328251 from native run
34539380960. Its sole failed target was hagency-permissions coordinator: seven
passed and native_codex_approval_uncertainty_write_cancel_restart failed at the
unqualified seen assertion. Shutdown and all other original targets passed,
including three ADR062 real owned Matrix tests. No ShutdownSnapshot failure
was present. Later serial Matrix/Palpo transport diagnostics passed, including
an expected should-panic Identity case; they do not supersede the original
approval failure or establish a historical shutdown cause.

The original cancellation timer covered database consumption before write entry.
Its assertion incorrectly excluded the real committed-Applying/no-byte state
already proven by the passed attach/consume lost-response fixture. Exact original
instruction timing is not observable in the log. In an isolated c0afefc worktree,
the four original uncertainty tests also passed locally; that is separate evidence.
The correction gates cancellation on the actual blocked writer with a bounded
phase wait, retains the same 30 ms cancellation interval and all restart/no-retry
assertions, and adds mode labels. No production, authority, deadline or cleanup
code changed. Logs are retained in the external windows-c0afefc evidence files.

Final fixture verification completed before the parallel agent reached its usage
limit: all eight coordinator tests, native and Windows GNU Clippy, and strict
lifecycle3/3 over all five explicit paths pass. The coordinator verified those
retained logs and source diff, then completed the commit. Actual Windows rerun
remains required; cross-compilation and local success do not replace it.


## 2026-09-10 — Combined usage, approval intake and media verification

Integrated ADR063 usage/schema17, ADR067 operator aggregate reads, ADR065
terminal event refusals, ADR064 private owner verdict intake, ADR066 retained
media staging and the Windows approval fixture correction at revision 37a0010.
The locked workspace all-target suite passes 416 unique tests plus one
proxy-environment child (417 printed), 81 suite summaries, with zero failures or
ignored tests. All 272 Rust specification selectors resolve. Workspace all-target
Clippy with warnings denied, rustfmt and whitespace checks pass. Full logs remain
in the external combined-usage-approval-media evidence cache.

The previous pushed c0afefc native run 34539380960 passed Linux and macOS. Its
original Windows job passed all three owned Matrix workflow tests, but failed one
approval cancellation assertion; later transport diagnostics do not replace that
failed result. The correction now synchronizes on actual write entry without
changing production behavior. A fresh Windows run is still required, including
creation-only media journal ACL sealing. Node run 34539380958 passed 4,288 tests
with one existing skip and eight actual native-addon media oracle vectors. Those
remote results qualify c0afefc only.

Native approvals now have authenticated owner intake, while proof of runtime
application remains open. Media staging retains bytes and descriptors but has no
network transfer or file tools. Usage reports preserve uncertainty and do not
enforce quotas. Browser/service wiring, retention, runtime/sandbox qualification
and all inventory parity gates remain open. This is a development checkpoint,
not a completed migration or authorization to change the live installation.

Integrated strict lifecycle checks also pass: usage ledger 9/9 across 30 paths;
usage reads 4/4 across 15; per-event refusal 6/6 across 14 and amended workflow
4/4 across five; approval intake 6/6 across 20; media staging 7/7 across 13;
Windows fixture 3/3 across five. The documentation checkpoint runs the owned
dispatch lifecycle at workspace scope, with all four changed documents explicit.
No fail, skip, uncertain or pending-review verdict was counted as passing.


## 2026-09-10 — Scoped runtime usage observations

ADR069 retains the actual SessionDriver tokenUsage notification as a fixed optional
counter projection with exact source/sequence. The default Update remains Progress.
Total and last remain separate, missing/invalid/future evidence stays explicit,
and the progress attachment consumes receipts without manufacturing tool activity.
Four new actual-stream regressions pass, along with the complete runtime/progress
affected suites and warnings-denied Clippy. No transcript, ledger, quota or service
wiring is claimed; this supplies typed capture for the later attribution adapter.

The full affected runtime/progress run passes59 tests. Final strict lifecycle
passes5/5 across all12 explicit changed paths. Its first attempt recorded one
uncertain scenario because a concurrently compiled media-test metadata import
failed before that selector ran. That fixture compile error was corrected and
the entire lifecycle rerun passed; the original uncertain result is retained.


## 2026-09-10 — Linux media directory sync correction

NativeCI34543863628 at3b5db90 passed macOS but failed all seven Linux media-store
cases at Store::create with OutcomeUnknown. All other original Linux targets
passed. Source tracing found cap-std's retained ambient directory is O_PATH on
Linux; duplicating it cannot make fsync valid. The fix opens fixed relative dot
under that retained directory, checks the same device/inode and unchanged private
permissions, then retains that readable descriptor for directory sync. Actual
flush failure still quarantines; no ambient path or permission fallback is added.

All eight media tests and warnings-denied Clippy pass locally; strict lifecycle
passes3/3 across six paths. The added metadata comparison initially mixed cap-std
and std extension traits and failed compilation; using the cloned std handle
corrected it without weakening the identity assertion. Its real Linux branch
asserts O_PATH EBADF before corrected sync and remains for actual CI. A stopped
local Docker daemon supplies no Linux execution evidence. Windows directory
sync uncertainty and existing macOS behavior are unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 — Bounded native encrypted media download

ADR068 adds MediaDownloader over the existing hardened Matrix HTTPS client and
attachment Codec. Typed MXC components select only a repository path under the
configured origin. Separate binary framing checks require complete HTTP body EOF,
finite actual bytes and descriptor hash validation before checked plaintext.
Clones share active-transfer and retained-result permits; dropped futures and
static errors release only their own buffers. Descriptor provenance, current
dispatch authority, media staging, uploads and room sending remain separate gates.
No SDK or domain/file state is opened; the Linux ADR066 directory-sync correction
is independent and changes no assumption in this transport.

Focused local TLS tests pass6/6. All affected Matrix and codec tests pass84/84
(65 Matrix unit, six media-download integration, nine existing transport and four
codec tests), with no ignored tests. The first focused run correctly refused an
unclean close-delimited TLS EOF: Fake previously dropped TlsStream without sending
close_notify. The approved fixture change performs bounded graceful shutdown and
retains an explicit unclean response; missing chunk terminators, truncated lengths
and integrity failures still fail. Initial manifest inheritance incorrectly assumed
base64 was workspace-shared; pinned existing0.22.1 fixed that check. Clippy found
a complex fixture response tuple, replaced by a named test-only response struct.
Original failures remain in external media-download-* evidence logs.

Final native and Windows GNU warnings-denied Clippy, formatting and whitespace
checks pass. Strict agent-spec1.4 lifecycle passes7/7 (six bound selectors plus
all11 explicit changed paths), with zero failed/skipped/uncertain/pending-review
results. Nonblocking lint heuristics request metadata and absence/JSON-preservation
scenario wording; no heuristic warning is counted as a test pass. The unchanged
JSON path is additionally covered by the complete affected Matrix suite. Parent
independent review found no blocking issue; allocator wording now distinguishes
logical payload caps from allocator rounding and total physical RSS. Actual
Linux/macOS/Windows integrated execution remains the coordinator's CI gate.


## 2026-09-10 — Actual Windows outgoing failures identified

The original Windows job103092158594 at3b5db90 completed with eight outgoing
library failures (Matrix56pass/8fail), while all seven media staging cases and
all eight approval coordinator cases passed, including the corrected write-cancel
phase. One outgoing failure directly exposed claim_final_reply OutcomeUnknown;
two exposed an early collector OutcomeUnknown and five only a missing scripted
HTTP request. The60,000 argument is a lease, not the bounded writer response
deadline. Logs do not prove the source of that delay or a production defect.

The old serial diagnostic reran only Matrix9 and Palpo13 transport tests, all
passing; it missed every failed outgoing library case and cannot reverse the
original result. A new failure-only five-minute step runs native_matrix_outgoing
serially with the SAME workspace/all-target feature selection. The normal full
suite stays fatal, production deadlines/assertions remain unchanged, and existing
transport diagnostics remain. Original and split logs are retained externally.


## 2026-09-10 — Integrated download and usage checkpoint

At5b83591 the locked all-target workspace passes427 unique tests plus one
proxy-environment child (428printed),82 suite summaries and zero failures/ignored.
All287 Rust selectors resolve; full warnings-denied Clippy, formatting and
whitespace checks pass. Integrated ADR068 lifecycle passes7/7 across11paths.
Independent ADR069 review found no blocker and confirmed historical source
validity is not current execution authority. Runtime/progress attachment remains
separate from ledger attribution. The later diagnostic-only CI change parses as
YAML and its scoped lifecycle passes3/3 across four paths.

NativeCI at3b5db90 remains failed on Linux and Windows; macOS and Node passed.
The Linux directory handle correction and new Windows outgoing diagnostics are
ready for fresh actual CI. No safe migration/cutover claim follows from local
success. Evidence remains in the external combined-download-usage logs.

## 2026-09-10 — Typed untrusted runtime usage normalization

ADR071 supplies fixed optional Codex counter DTOs and a pure UsageObservation
constructor without fabricating transcript JSON or introducing runtime/store
dependencies. The actual pinned upstream cache-write fixture normalizes
input100/read40/write60/output10 into fresh0/read40/write60/output10. Reasoning,
last-response and context values stay separate evidence. Invalid values sanitize
to unknown; impossible fresh input remains unknown and contradictions are
diagnosed. Known normalized category overflow returns no observation. Evidence
is versioned, content-bound and always stream-incomplete; it grants no source,
provider, quota or canonical authority. ADR070 owns the separate host adapter.

All ten metering tests pass: five retained parser tests and five new typed runtime
selectors. Coverage includes every retained digest field, all twelve unsafe and
missing counter positions, context limits, checked arithmetic with unknown fields,
upstream context-reset shape, repeated/growing/regressing cumulative snapshots,
and exact unchanged transcript observation JSON. Focused native and Windows GNU
warnings-denied Clippy pass; cross-compilation is not Windows runtime evidence.
Strict agent-spec1.4 lifecycle passes6/6, including all five bound selectors and
eight explicit changed paths, with no skipped uncertain failed or pending-review
verdicts. The crate-scoped code root avoids a redundant full workspace build.
Formatting and whitespace checks pass. Evidence is in external
typed-runtime-usage-* logs; no live runtime was contacted.


## 2026-09-10 — Owned runtime usage reaches the historical ledger

ADR070 binds the exact acknowledged Started scope before native child creation,
then attaches only the private operation's fresh OwnedSession. Every observed
update advances the same source sequence; usage passes through ADR071 without
synthetic transcript JSON. One exact normalized pending tuple survives cancelled
waits and lost responses. Capture failures close new admission, while existing
runner cleanup, canonical completion and delivery still run independently. A
normalization refusal retains the fixed original counter projection; an explicit
retry cannot convert it into an admitted record. Runtime evidence always remains
stream-incomplete and aggregate labels now cover untrusted usage from both forms.

The first focused run failed three new fixture setups because project proof
timestamps were compared with wall-clock time rather than their fixture clock.
Correcting only admission/approval fixture timestamps let all eight initial
capture tests pass. Clippy then found the common test module loaded twice; both
unit modules now share one crate-local fixture import. A later actual native
capacity fixture proves storage refusal leaves protocol completion independent.
All25 affected execution/metering tests and warnings-denied Clippy now pass.
No source/receipt capacity, production timeout or execution assertion was weakened.

Independent review corrected reattachment testing after source sequence advancement
and required the retained normalization rejection. The integrated locked workspace passes441 unique tests plus one proxy child
(442 printed),83 suite summaries and zero failures/ignored. All301 Rust selectors
resolve. Full workspace warnings-denied Clippy, Windows GNU affected Clippy,
formatting and whitespace checks pass. Strict agent-spec1.4 lifecycle passes10/10, covering all nine bound scenarios
and all20 explicit changed paths, with zero failed/skipped/uncertain/pending-review
verdicts. The fixed metadata/no-authority lint suggestions do not alter those results. No live provider or runtime state
was opened, and no deployment or service cutover is enabled.


At a2f8348, actual native CI34545625733 completed successfully on all three
platforms and Node CI34545625740 passed. Linux printed429 passes (428 unique plus
one proxy child), macOS428 (427 unique plus child), Windows425 (424 unique plus
child); each has82 suite summaries and zero failed/ignored. Platform-specific
selectors account for the different counts. Linux's new retained-directory fsync
regression passed. Windows passed all19 outgoing cases, media8/8, download6/6 and
approval8/8; both failure-only diagnostics were skipped, not additional evidence.
All release builds and Clippy passed. The old3b5db90 Windows failures remain
unexplained. These results concern a2f8348, not the later usage capture changes.

## 2026-09-10 — Bounded encrypted media upload transport

ADR072 adds an actual binary HTTPS POST primitive under the existing hardened
client. A caller-held attempt borrows the exact SDK Encrypted object, retains a
finite slot and moves irreversibly to WritePossible before request polling.
Future drop, cancellation, timeout or invalid responses preserve uncertainty and
the caller's ciphertext/descriptor custody. Accepted is stored only after complete
bounded unambiguous JSON, validated MXC and a final cancellation/deadline check.
Neither an error nor a returned URI establishes room/event/delivery authority or
safe automatic retry. No domain/file-tool/live service or staged-media adapter is
enabled. Existing JSON and download methods remain unchanged.

Five real local TLS selectors pass with actual retained file snapshots and SDK
encryption. They inspect exact ciphertext, bearer destination and absent secret
metadata; exercise valid4096/refused4097 response size, duplicate fields, invalid
MXCs, malformed framing, header limits, truncated/unclean EOF, cancellation,
future drop, header/body/absolute deadlines, terminal no-resend and shared active
plus held-attempt limits. Header-negative fixtures carry otherwise valid URI
bodies. Initial test compilation exposed only a helper-name shadow and unused
import, fixed before executing tests; original log is retained externally.
All 85 affected Matrix tests pass: 65 library, 6 download, 5 upload and 9
transport. Native and Windows GNU all-target Clippy pass with warnings denied;
the first Clippy run requested one equivalent boolean simplification, corrected
without changing policy. Windows cross-check is compilation evidence only;
actual Windows execution remains an integration CI gate. Formatting and diff
checks pass. Strict crate-scoped agent-spec lifecycle passes 6/6 (five bound TLS
selectors plus the explicit eleven-path boundary), with zero failed, skipped,
uncertain or pending-review verdicts. External media-upload-* logs retain the
original failures and successful checks. No full workspace build or live
service was needed.


## 2026-09-10 — Integrated usage capture and upload checkpoint

The isolated migration branch now includes ADR071 typed counters(e45043c),
ADR070 exact owned capture(22503a1) and ADR072 encrypted upload(0f18bdc).
The upload merge had only an append-only progress-note conflict; all parent and
agent lines were retained and checked. Cargo adds one local execution-to-metering
edge and two Matrix test-only edges, with no package/version additions.

At22503a1 the locked workspace passes441 unique tests plus one proxy child,
83 suite summaries and zero failed/ignored. All301 selectors resolve and full
workspace warnings-denied Clippy plus affected Windows GNU Clippy pass. Integrated
ADR071 lifecycle passes6/6 across8paths, separately from ADR070's10/10 across20.
After upload integration, all85 affected Matrix tests pass again from the edited
root tree. The new shared HTTP path is independent of JSON and download behavior;
parent review required and confirmed the final cancellation/deadline check before
Accepted. Workspace warnings-denied Clippy passes, and integrated strict upload lifecycle
passes6/6 across all11 explicit changed paths. The new fixture is not a live
homeserver or an actual Windows runtime qualification; fresh CI remains required.

Uploads still lack durable staged-byte recovery, event authority, file-tool and
service integration. A possible HTTP write is not retry permission. Native owner
approval application, full room/history behavior, physical provisioning/sandbox,
quotas, console and release parity remain open; no M0-M9 milestone is complete.

Integrated upload binding enumeration resolves306 Rust selectors with no missing
tests. The final documentation scope check also passed10/10, including its three
explicit paths; agent-spec executed the bound tests despite the requested
lint/boundary layers. This rerun is recorded separately, not as new coverage.

## 2026-09-10 — Authenticated attachment visibility implementation checkpoint

ADR073 now adds domain schema018: safe metadata and a private SDK manifest
reference commit with exact verified Matrix ingress. New dispatches freeze both
source and projection sequence. Host-only tickets require the current Started
capability and exact route, with a separate revalidation operation for use after
asynchronous IO. Verified task activation copies only existing proven input;
follow-up dispatches retain earlier authorized files without same-room access.

Five focused repository tests pass, covering atomic rollback, finite admission,
changed replay, late projection, follow-up lineage, cross-Agent source conflict,
null-root DM promotion, expiry, revoke, restart and schema17 upgrade. Original
fixture errors are retained externally: wrong revoke signature, missing capacity
fixture foreign-key rows, then omitted SQL column order. They were corrected in
the tests without weakening schema constraints. Store all-target warnings-denied
Clippy passes. Full affected store regressions and strict lifecycle are pending.
No download, runner tool, cache path or production service is enabled. Matrix
authenticated descriptor retention is proceeding separately as ADR074.
