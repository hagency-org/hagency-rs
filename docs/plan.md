# Native migration working plan

This is coordination, not canonical runtime task state. There is no provisioned
`task-writer` in this source checkout. User instruction: execute the Rust migration
in a clean worktree. Branch `feat/rust-migration`; baseline `5dbef22`.

1. M0/M1 first checkpoint: native Salvo process, protected fresh state, custody,
   recovery, bounded work, shared protocol vectors and offline encrypted SDK proof.
2. Verify native CI on Windows, macOS and Linux, plus existing build-tool coverage.
3. Continue M0's complete dynamic endpoint/helper classification, supported runtime
   versions and measured device budgets. Run early process-tree/sandbox proofs.
4. M2 selected-resource domain checkpoint now implements verified-observation
   admission, one-transaction reservations/outbox and uncertain-effect recovery.
   Model qualification, derived catalogs and scoped cross-family checks now use
   the shared policy. Complete legacy/project-side/rotation integration.
   The M3 task/dispatch kernel now shares the domain database: current capabilities,
   atomic mutation receipts, frozen payloads, resource leases and conservative
   restart recovery. Canonical session resolution, per-session message projections
   and atomic dispatch input claims are now implemented in schema 4. Continue the
   internal group/MCP surfaces, task dependencies and durable final replies.
   Schema 5 now provides canonical task metadata, input activation through a
   fenced notice outbox, scoped delegation and start-time human follow-up. The scoped runner HTTP API now exposes task reads,
   comments, mutations and frozen inbox through the bounded writer, using its
   execution-time clock. The pure graph planner now matches the existing dependency policy using
   JavaScript-derived vectors. Schema 6 now provides explicit internal routes and atomic scoped conversation
   admission. Schema 7 now adds durable peer messages, exact-session recipients,
   dispatch-owned input and inspected recovery. Continue group lifecycle and atomic
   graph/task linkage before graph execution. Schema 8 now binds inspected-result
   reporting to the completed task epoch, separately from work creation authority.
   Actual final reply delivery remains to implement.
   Schema 9 now adds creator-scoped group member changes/closure, fresh rejoin
   sessions and durable host stop intents. Retired started work retains resource
   custody until inspected settlement; canonical tasks and input history remain.
   Schema 10 now binds finite task graphs to canonical node tasks, immutable
   assignment inputs and completed-epoch results. Current capabilities and
   inspected report grants remain distinct. Cancellation and scope retirement
   retain unknown leases and concurrency until host inspection. Continue final
   reply privacy/delivery, graph tool adapters and actual runner stop observation.
   Schema 11 now freezes explicit host-observed Matrix routes for fresh sessions
   and separates bounded final intent, send custody and observed delivery.
   Negative membership/privacy observations retire old sessions; cancelled or
   uncertain sends cannot silently resume. Continue real authenticated Matrix
   task-intent/session integration, arbitrary room/DM policy, taskless output and
   transport inspection before treating this as an operational reply bridge.
   The initial hagency-platform proof now launches explicit native probes: Windows
   atomic Job Object assignment and POSIX unreaped-leader group cancellation.
   Continue native Windows CI validation, POSIX guardian/detached-child ownership,
   bounded runner IO and effective sandbox proofs before real runner adapters.
   Opaque child signal identities now use pidfds/process handles/macOS audit-token
   versions, with read-only birth metadata kept separate from signal authority.
   Extend those primitives to verified descendant adoption and guardian handoff.
   Native guardian handoff now uses an anonymous bounded prepare/start protocol;
   owner EOF, malformed input and leader exit cancel the owned process group.
   Continue detached-descendant adoption and guardian-loss recovery; a POSIX
   group report still does not establish full cleanup or sandbox enforcement.
   Linux now adopts orphaned descendants through a dedicated subreaper and
   validates pidfd waitability before signalling; only kernel ECHILD after root
   reaping can establish observed full cleanup. Actual Linux/Windows detached
   fixtures remain a CI gate for this step; macOS still refuses that guarantee.
5. Continue M3–M9 in the migration plan; keep production deployments independent
   until every cutover gate is met. A foundation build is not full migration parity.
