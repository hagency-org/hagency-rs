//! Test-only approval phase diagnostics (ADR-046 stage-1, no behavior change).
//!
//! Two structures, both compiled only under `cfg(test)` or the default-off
//! `test-diagnostics` feature:
//!
//! * a process-wide **phase journal** — every phase label appended to a
//!   pending entry's trace, in arrival order, so a test can read the exact
//!   sequence one entry drove through the coordinator;
//! * a **cancellation slot** — the offending entry ids and their traces at
//!   the moment a cancellation primitive fired, so a failing assertion can
//!   name the primitive (resolved-before-write vs turn-ended-unwritten), the
//!   entry, and every phase that entry had reached.
//!
//! Both are keyed by the **operation's dispatch id** (`RunnerCapability::
//! dispatch_id`): hosted CI runs tests in parallel inside one process, and a
//! process-wide slot interleaved records from different tests — the VM trace
//! once listed two different phase histories for the same entry id because
//! two tests each drove an `approval-1`. A test reads only its own
//! operation's records; [`reset`] still clears everything.
//!
//! Production builds compile none of this: no field, no string, no slot.
