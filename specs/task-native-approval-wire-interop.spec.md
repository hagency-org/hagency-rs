## Intent

Implement ADR115's explicit paired peer-schema amendment in an isolated tree at
1baa80d. Preserve exact native forty-hex and retained thirty-two-hex request IDs,
typed upstream metadata and the already accepted finite scoped choices. Validate
actual original-writer cards, without changing domain or Matrix authority.

## Constraints

### Must
- Admit exactly thirty-two or forty lowercase hexadecimal characters after approval_ without rewriting the identifier.
- Preserve legacy field limits; bound the native profile by its existing 48 KiB encoded packet limit with explicit schema field ceilings.
- Keep private detail objects closed, preserve exact bindings and require reusable scope for task or always choices.
- Keep once and deny in canonical order and reject duplicate unknown reordered or unscoped reusable actions.
- Validate checked-in fixture bytes captured from the actual original-writer card test and retain reproducible generation evidence.
- Run exact Node selectors separately from the Cargo-only lifecycle and report skips as nonpassing.

### Must Not
- No producer authority, permission, request ID, native schema version, client, runtime or live service change.
- No truncation, display-based permission, schema validation as authentication, or complete client interoperability claim.

## Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: The corpus comes from real current private writer cards
  Test: native_approval_wire_corpus
  Given original native requests in actual isolated SQLite fixtures
  When current private cards are created for fixed operation and scope cases
  Then exact emitted JSON is recorded without substituting a hand-authored producer

Scenario: Both accepted peer profiles validate without rewriting bindings
  Test: native approval wire profiles
  Given actual native cards and retained JavaScript producer controls
  When request and verdict schemas validate each finite scope choice
  Then complete original IDs and bindings survive and typed RPC metadata stays request-only

Scenario: Malformed and oversized profiles never become schema-valid
  Test: native approval wire refusals
  Given valid original packets
  When IDs scopes ordering metadata bounds or closed detail fields change
  Then invalid packets refuse and exact legacy limits remain unchanged

## Out of Scope

Robrix parser and owned-click origin fixes, encrypted SDK sending, and executable
approval coordination remain separately qualified work. JSON Schema cannot
express the encoded-byte budget; the actual producer and explicit wire validator
tests enforce that separate ceiling. Schema conformance is not event authority.
