## Intent

Bind the production provisioning ingress the store already assumes: the
native product must be able to provision an engagement the way the retained
product does. Today `DomainRepository::admit` is the only engagement-minting
write, but no production code calls it or `verify_request` — every native
agent in every test was admitted by a fixture. This slice wires the Matrix
intake admission chain (owner message → intake admit → provider approval →
effect observed) to `verify_request` and `admit`, exactly as ADR-095's
2026-09-14 amendment decides.

## Constraints

### Must
- Observe the provisioning request through the production Matrix ingress: the `com.hagency.engagement.request.v1` event carried by the fake peer, whose body carries a **native-valid `request_id`** (the idempotency key) and the Matrix event id as the **`source_event_id`**.
- Verify it with the same `verify_request` (`hagency-core/src/authority.rs:196`) — the event-type, source-event, room and sender checks already there — so an unverified request is refused **before** `admit`.
- Call `DomainRepository::admit` exactly once for a verified request — the single minting write — and observe the provider approval as the separate `approve` verdict, never folded into the mint.
- Key idempotency on `request_id`: an identical duplicate (same `request_id` + same digest) replays the prior admission; a same-`request_id` different-content request is refused as a conflict — never a second INSERT.

### Must Not
- Do not mint an engagement outside `admit` — no second INSERT, no direct roster write, no fixture-style seeding in the production path.
- Do not change `admit`, `verify_request`, the `VerifiedRequest` shape or any store schema; this slice wires the production caller, it does not move the write.
- Do not add a console create-agent HTTP route — the ingress is Matrix intake, not a REST endpoint (the console `agents.rs` stays GET + `{id}/start|stop|preset`).
- Do not gate any scenario by OS or feature in the binding set.

## Decisions (2026-09-14, integration fix-up after the builder's blocker report)

- The reception room is **pre-project**. A `com.hagency.engagement.request.v1` event observed there never carries a `ReplyRoute` (that shape binds a project, an owner and a fleet, none of which exist before admission) and is never resolved through `targets()`; the intake routes it by discriminator to `provision()` **before** target resolution, so `event_batch`'s `NotTarget` drop never sees it. Session routes keep refusing the reception room (`matrix_routes.rs` stays outside this slice).
- The reception room enters the observed set through a dedicated `HostConfig` field (hence `config.rs` in Allowed Changes) filled at bootstrap from the store's recorded registration that `registration_fingerprint` names — store-driven and fail-closed (ADR-095 amendment 2026-09-14): a registration without a reception room is a named startup refusal, never a silent skip and never a new operator-supplied config field.
- The provisioning facts (`RoomObservation` ×3, binding, name, powers) come from the collector's own room-state snapshots of the reception, project and owner rooms, as already committed on the builder's branch.

## Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: A provider-approved request provisions an engagement through the production ingress
  Test: native_provisioning_ingress_admits_a_provider_approved_request
  Level: integration
  Test Double: the shared fake peer delivering a com.hagency.engagement.request.v1 event, plus the collector's own room-state snapshots for the reception, project and owner rooms
  Given an intake event with kind com.hagency.engagement.request.v1 whose body carries the retained request fields (requestId = a native-valid request_id distinct from the event id, source_event_id = the event id, project, projectRoomId, role, requester, requestedTokens, ratePerDay, agent, context)
  When the intake hook assembles the ProjectRequest and the three RoomObservations from the collector's SDK facts and calls verify_request then DomainStore::admit
  Then admit runs exactly once and the engagement exists with its minted en_ id — the provider verdict is observed afterwards as the separate approve step, never folded into the mint
  Production caller: hagency_matrix::intake::Inner::provision -> hagency_store::domain_worker::DomainRepository::admit

Scenario: An identical duplicate provisioning request replays the prior admission
  Test: native_provisioning_ingress_replays_an_identical_duplicate
  Level: integration
  Test Double: the same event delivered twice with the same request_id and the same content digest
  Given a request already admitted for a request_id (the requester's native-valid idempotency key)
  When the identical event is delivered again
  Then the prior admission is returned and counted replayed — no second engagement row is minted
  Production caller: hagency_matrix::intake::Inner::provision -> hagency_store::domain_worker::DomainRepository::admit

Scenario: A same-key different-content request is refused as a conflict and quarantined
  Test: native_provisioning_ingress_refuses_a_conflicting_request_by_the_same_key
  Level: integration
  Test Double: the same request_id delivered with a different content digest
  Given a request already admitted for a request_id whose content digest differs
  When the conflicting event is delivered
  Then the ingress refuses it as a conflict on the same request_id key and quarantines it — no second engagement row is minted
  Production caller: hagency_matrix::intake::Inner::provision -> hagency_store::domain_worker::DomainRepository::admit

Scenario: An unverified or unenrolled provisioning request is refused before admit
  Test: native_provisioning_ingress_refuses_unverified_before_admit
  Level: integration
  Test Double: a request event whose assembled RequestObservation fails the verify_request checks (a missing/expired room snapshot or a mismatched binding), or whose owner has no enrolled owner room
  Given a request whose room snapshots, powers, binding or sender do not satisfy verify_request, or whose owner has no enrolled owner room in the store
  When the intake hook assembles the observation
  Then it is refused before admit runs with a named reason — an unverified request and an unenrolled owner both fail closed — and no engagement row exists
  Production caller: hagency_matrix::intake::Inner::provision -> hagency_store::domain_worker::DomainRepository::admit

## Decisions

**The ingress is Matrix intake, not a console route.** There is no native
create-agent HTTP route, and this slice adds none: the product provisions
through the Matrix admission chain, and the store's own `admit`/`approve`
pair is the write surface — this slice only gives them their production
caller.

Scenario: The provider approval produces the provision effect
  Owed Selector: native_provisioning_effect_produced (parked — owed by the G2 wiring slice; no Test: line here yet)
  Given an admitted engagement pending provider approval
  When the provider approval is recorded by the wired approval path
  Then the effects row carries kind=provision for the engagement
  Production caller: owed (G2)

Scenario: The provision effect is claimed and observed complete
  Owed Selector: native_provisioning_effect_completed (parked — owed by the G2 wiring slice; no Test: line here yet)
  Given a recorded provision effect for an admitted engagement
  When the wired effect worker claims the effect and reports the provision outcome
  Then the effects row carries kind=provision state=complete and the engagement_ends row is observed
  Production caller: owed (G2)

Scenario: The admitted engagement's project room binds a session route
  Owed Selector: native_provisioning_session_route (parked — owed by the G3 wiring slice; no Test: line here yet)
  Given an admitted engagement with its project room and an intake plan naming a configured session id
  When the wired route registrar resolves the verified Matrix session
  Then the matrix_session_routes row binds the project room to the configured session id so the intake plan's session resolves
  Production caller: owed (G3)

## Out of Scope

The provider-approval verdict surface itself (already owned by the
approval ADRs), resource/seat allocation decisions (ADR-121/122/123), the
console roster read, and any change to `admit`/`verify_request`.
