## Intent

Bind the agent-roster read-only observation (ADR-126): a `/console/api/agents`
projection of the engagement rows that omits every private field the retained
`GET /api/agents` response spreads, and the `/console/agents/` page that renders
it. One spec per page family, per the house pattern (the usage and engagements
reads live in the usage spec; the alerts page in the ceiling-alert spec). Browser
selectors follow the same gated lane that spec's Decisions block records:
compiled only under the default-off `native-console-browser` feature, listed by
`cargo test --list` under `--all-features` exactly as `native_console_browser`
is bound there, executed only in the enabled lane.

## Constraints

### Must
- Mount `GET /console/api/agents` under the console `authenticate` hoop with no scope: scope facts are a payload, never a gate on reads.
- Serve exactly the seven declared keys with no nested object; `null` means unknown, never zero.
- Derive `last_activity_ms` as the newest `runner_attempts.created_at` among the engagement's dispatches — and a dispatch with no attempt row reports `null`.
- Publish a server-owned `unavailable` list naming every column native has no source for.
- Stage the page through the asset key map, mime allowlist and `/console/agents` alias; the required key `/console/usage/` stays.
- Keep the client's exact-key validator on the roster wire item.

### Must Not
- Do not serve a credential home, workdir, state dir, workspace path, tmux target, pane buffer or token through any key.
- Do not add a new scope, a fourth ticket, or a task/progress/utilisation column the retained roster refuses.
- Do not widen the five-document exception; the page serves as a non-document with no query string.
- Do not gate a whole scenario by OS or by feature in the binding set.

## Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: The agent roster observation omits every private field
  Test: native_console_agent_roster_observation
  Given the roster read behind the console authenticate hoop with at least one engagement carrying a live session
  When the roster is read through a valid session
  Then every item carries exactly the seven declared keys and no key names a credential home tmux target workspace path or token and no item carries any nested object
  And an engagement with no session row reports last_activity_ms null rather than zero
  And the top-level unavailable list names every column native has no source for

Scenario: A foreign origin cannot read the agent roster
  Test: native_console_agent_roster_refuses_foreign_origin
  Given a valid console session cookie
  When the roster is read with a cross-site sec-fetch-site or a foreign host or origin
  Then the route refuses with console_origin_required and serves no agent item

Scenario: The agent roster page renders under the native browser boundary
  Test: native_console_agent_roster_browser
  Given the native console fixture and the built agent page with the native-console-browser feature whose selectors appear in cargo test --list under --all-features exactly as native_console_browser is bound by the usage console spec
  When real Chromium opens /console/agents without any operator token
  Then the roster reaches data-native-state ready with no external request and no credential value on screen

Scenario: The roster shows an agent whose engagement was minted by the production ingress
  Test: native_console_roster_shows_an_ingress_provisioned_agent
  Given a production intake that admitted a com.hagency.engagement.request.v1 event and a representative verdict that made the engagement effective and bound its session route
  When the operator lists the agent roster through the real GET /console/api/agents route
  Then the roster carries an item whose engagement_id is the engagement the store minted by request_id (never seeded), and the engagements row, the effects row in kind=provision state=complete, and the matrix_session_routes row for that engagement all exist
  Production caller: hagency::console::agents::list

## Out of Scope

The agent lifecycle (start/stop/preset behind a finite scope), a CLI read via an
`/api/native/v1/agents` operator route, the rail row (a retained-file edit), and
every other console page.
