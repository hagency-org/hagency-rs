## Intent

Bind the M8 item-4 half the audit named: storage and network fault
injection — disk-full on the store, partial upload and server rejection on
the outbound adapter — with the custody outcome **named in the store's own
words** for each (`unknown`, `rejected`, or a clean engine failure), never a
silent success. The outcomes are decided by the records that own them:
ADR-037 (outbound custody — started claims become `unknown`; a lost or
rejected response retains it), ADR-078 (file-upload custody —
`mark_upload_uncertain` retains the original fence) and ADR-083
(upload-response custody — partial body, failed EOF never acquires
authority). This spec adds no decision, it binds the injections that prove
those records' outcomes.

## Constraints

### Must
- Inject disk-full on the store portably: SQLite's `max_page_count` pragma (or an equivalent engine-level limit) — never a real tmpfs or filesystem fill; the limit is set, the write is attempted, the failure is observed, and the limit is restored.
- Assert the disk-full outcome as the store yields it today: the write returns `Error::Sqlite` carrying the engine's database-full/disk message, never swallowed, no partial row survives, the store remains readable and writable within the limit afterwards — never a silent success and never a torn write.
- Inject a partial upload on the outbound adapter against the shared fake peer: a transfer interrupted mid-body, so the outcome cannot be proven delivered.
- Assert the partial-upload outcome: the store records the publication state **`unknown`** (ADR-037's started-claims-become-unknown; ADR-078/083's upload custody), the original fence is retained, and no runtime gains transport authority from it.
- Inject a server rejection on the outbound adapter: the fake peer serves a definitive rejection response.
- Assert the rejection outcome: the store records the publication state **`rejected`** (`repository.rs:616-625` maps `PublicationResponse::Rejected` to `"rejected"`), never retried silently, never reported delivered.

### Must Not
- Do not use real filesystem fills, tmpfs mounts or disk partitioning — the injection is engine-level and portable.
- Do not weaken or rename any existing custody selector; the existing custody scenarios keep their words.
- Do not inject faults into live services, real homeservers or the production host.
- Do not gate any scenario by OS or feature in the binding set.

## Boundaries

### Allowed Changes
- native/hagency-store/tests/ (the disk-full injection)
- native/hagency-store/src/repository.rs (one documented unconditional test seam: `open_with_page_limit(path, max_pages)`)
- native/hagency-store/src/domain.rs (the same seam, exposing it on the domain constructor)
- native/hagency-matrix/tests/ (the outbound injections against the fake peer)
- native/hagency/tests/
- native/scripts/
- specs/task-rust-native-fault-injection.spec.md
- docs/progress.md

### Forbidden
- Live services, live homeservers, credentials, deployed state.
- native/hagency-store/src/** except the one licensed seam above (the store's behavior is otherwise asserted, not changed — this includes not introducing a named capacity error); native/hagency-matrix/src/**.

## Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: The store fails closed on an injected disk-full write
  Owed Selector: native_store_fails_closed_on_disk_full (parked — the name is owed by the implementing slice and binds only when it lands; no Test: line here yet)
  Level: integration
  Test Double: SQLite max_page_count set to the current page count, the write attempted, the limit restored
  Given a live store at its current size with the disk-full limit injected
  When a write is attempted past the limit
  Then the write returns Error::Sqlite carrying the engine's database-full/disk message and no partial row survives
  And the store remains readable and writable within the limit afterwards
  And the limit is restored afterwards — never a real filesystem fill

Scenario: A partial upload on the outbound adapter is recorded unknown
  Owed Selector: native_outbound_partial_upload_is_recorded_unknown (parked — binds with this slice; no Test: line here yet)
  Level: integration
  Test Double: the shared fake peer with a transfer interrupted mid-body
  Given an outbound upload interrupted after bytes have crossed
  When the adapter observes the interruption
  Then the publication state reads unknown and the original fence is retained
  And no runtime gains transport authority from the unknown outcome

Scenario: A server rejection on the outbound adapter is recorded rejected
  Owed Selector: native_outbound_server_rejection_is_recorded_rejected (parked — binds with this slice; no Test: line here yet)
  Level: integration
  Test Double: the shared fake peer serving a definitive rejection response
  Given an outbound send the peer definitively rejects
  When the rejection is observed
  Then the publication state reads rejected — never retried silently and never reported delivered

## Decisions

**The disk-full word is the engine's, and a named capacity error is a
follow-on, not this slice.** `max_page_count` exhaustion surfaces from
rusqlite as `Error::Sqlite` with the engine's message — and a named
capacity word would need a store change this slice does not license. If a
dedicated `Capacity` error word is the right product surface for an honest
disk-full refusal, that is a separate store slice with its own review;
this spec asserts the failure as it exists today.

**The one licensed store seam, documented and unconditional.** The
integration test cannot reach the writer connection otherwise
(`Repository.db` and `DomainRepository.db` are `pub(crate)` with no public
pragma surface, and a `#[cfg(test)]` window is invisible to the crate's
integration tests) — so exactly one seam is licensed: an unconditional
constructor variant `open_with_page_limit(path, max_pages)` that applies
`PRAGMA max_page_count` on the writer connection, default path unchanged,
no production caller, the same posture ADR-053's bounded-spawn amendment
records for its stall double. Everything else under `src/**` stays
forbidden.

**Injection is engine-level, always.** Disk-full is `max_page_count`, not a
filesystem fill: the fault must be portable to every CI lane and must not
depend on the runner's disk layout.

## Out of Scope

Network outage/reconnect drills (M8's dedicated lane), process-death and
lease-expiry scenarios (already bound by the dispatch specs), any change to
the store or adapter code, and a named capacity error (the follow-on above).
