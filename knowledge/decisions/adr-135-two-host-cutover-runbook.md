## Context

The migration plan §9 fixes the procedure ("Complete offline parity tests and
produce a versioned release plus rollback kit", `:474`; drain rule
"Record unresolved work explicitly; do not mark it done to simplify
shutdown", `:476-477`; quiesce and backup `:478-479`; fence `:480-481`;
init/import and validate `:482-483`; "Start Rust, verify local
API/authentication … Keep execution paused until owner and runner readiness
are proven", `:484-485`; bounded acceptance `:486-487`; "Resume intake,
observe reconnect/restart behavior, then retire JS services after the
acceptance window", `:488-489`) and the rollback limits ("Before Rust
creates external effects … rollback can restore the quiesced snapshot …
after stopping Rust", `:493-494`; "After Rust accepts requests, sends
messages, rotates credentials or executes work … Drain and reconcile
effects, then use a proven compatible state export or forward repair",
`:495-497`; crypto/generation/sent-events cannot be rewound `:498-499`;
"Never start the old runtime on an unknown newer schema or reuse a revoked
credential … **Preserve explicit unknown/pending states**", `:500-501`).
The service review adds the two-host concretes this runbook must carry: the
stop contract, the `/ready` start gate (the retained side has **no** `/ready`
at all), the port map (retained `127.0.0.1:8090` backend / `8084` dashboard,
`install-full.sh:432`, `install-macos.sh:404,422`, vs native
`127.0.0.1:13300`, `main.rs:103` — loopback-only, remote via SSH tunnel or
reverse proxy, the retained `.env` never merged into the native unit), the
version identity (native workspace `0.1.0` vs retained `1.2.0`, ADR-134's
separate channels), macOS `bootout`-before-unlink ordering (under
`KeepAlive: true` a kill re-spawns), and the native migration head
(`user_version: 25`; next free migration `026`) that makes §9's
"unknown newer schema" fence concrete.

## Decision

The runbook below is the procedure for the first cutover: one Linux host
(systemd, ADR-127) and one macOS host (launchd, ADR-133), fresh-install
profile (the plan's default — no importer; a deliberate importer is the
plan's separately gated option, `:461-462`). Each step names the command,
the check that proves it, the store's required state, the rollback step,
and the evidence recorded. Steps 1–3 are host-symmetric; 4+ differ by OS
where marked.

**0. Preconditions (both hosts).** Command: `hagency --version` on the
staged artifact. Check: output equals the workspace version and the
artifact filename's `nvX.Y.Z` (ADR-134). Store: none yet. Rollback: none
needed — nothing has run. Evidence: version line, artifact `SHA256SUMS`
entry, the workflow dispatch URL.

**1. Fresh native state.** Command:
`hagency init --state-dir /var/lib/hagency-native` (Linux) or
`~/Library/Application Support/hagency-native` (macOS). Check: `init`
succeeds and writes `operator.token` (it **refuses a non-empty dir**,
`main.rs:167-171`); mode 0600, service-user owned. Store: empty SQLite
pair created by init. Rollback: `rm -rf` the state dir — nothing else has
touched it. Evidence: `ls -l` of the token, the init stdout line.

**2. Install the unit.** Linux: run the SR-1 installer (render unit →
`daemon-reload` → `enable`). macOS: render the plist →
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.hagency.native.plist` (no `launchctl` yet).
Check: unit file exists, `ExecStart`/`ProgramArguments` names the
versioned artifact path and `--listen 127.0.0.1:13300`; plist keys per
ADR-133 (RunAtLoad, KeepAlive true, ThrottleInterval 10, log paths).
Rollback: remove the unit file / plist — nothing has started. Evidence:
the rendered file's checksum.

**3. Start and gate on `/ready` — never `/health`.** Linux:
`systemctl start hagency-native`; macOS:
`launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.hagency.native.plist`.
Check: poll `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:13300/ready` until the payload is
`"status":"ok"` with every component's state word ready; `/health` is
200-while-live and proves nothing (F8). Then `systemctl is-active` /
`launchctl print` for the manager's own view. Store: open, WAL files
present (normal for ADR-120). **Rollback point R1 starts here.** Rollback
(before any external effect): stop the unit (Linux `systemctl stop`;
macOS `launchctl bootout` — **bootout before any plist removal**, and never
kill by pid: KeepAlive true re-spawns), restore the state dir from the
step-1 copy if any drift is suspected, remove the unit. Evidence: the
`/ready` JSON at gate time, `is-active`/`launchctl print` output.

**4. Record the baseline and the migration head.** Command: on each host,
query the native store's `user_version` (read-only). Check: exactly `25`
(the head this runbook is written against; `026` is the next free
migration). This is §9's "unknown newer schema" fence made concrete: **if
either store reports a version newer than the artifact knows, stop — the
old runtime must not be started against it** (`:500-501`). Store: must be
at head 25 with zero rows of live work (fresh install). Evidence: the
version query output on both hosts.

**5. The bounded acceptance task** (plan `:486-487`). Command: run the
approved check in the dedicated validation scope — one bounded task,
follow-up, private approval, file transfer, revoke. Check: each completes
and reconciles; delivery and resource release recorded. Store: unknown and
pending rows **created by acceptance must be resolved or still explicitly
pending before proceeding** — never silently dropped. **Rollback point R1
ends here: from step 6 the store has accepted external effects and
snapshot-restore rollback is REFUSED** (plan `:495-497`); from here
rollback is drain-and-reconcile plus forward repair only. Evidence: the
acceptance transcript.

**6. Drain and stop test (the stop contract).** Command: stop the unit
(Linux `systemctl stop` within `TimeoutStopSec=20`; macOS
`launchctl bootout`). Check: `/ready` flips to 503 naming stopped
components while `/health` keeps 200; the process exits 0 inside the
budget **or parks on an unknown close without exiting 0**
(`bootstrap.rs:795-806`) — a park is not a failure; SIGKILL at the budget
leaves the WAL for the next open (ADR-120). Store after: closed cleanly or
parked-unknown; WAL present; pending/unknown rows **unchanged and
preserved**. Rollback: none — this step is itself the rollback rehearsal.
Evidence: exit status, the last `/ready` payload, `journalctl` /
`launchd` log tail.

**7. Restart and confirm preservation.** Command: start again (as step 3).
Check: `/ready` returns to ok; every pending/unknown row that existed
before step 6 is still reported pending/unknown — none resolved, none
dropped, none marked done (`:476-477`, `:501`). Store: same rows, same
states. Evidence: before/after row dumps.

**8. Resume intake; retire JS after the acceptance window**
(plan `:488-489`). Command: open intake on the native service; after the
window, stop the retained services (Linux `systemctl disable --now
hagency-backend hagency-push-relay [bridge-matrix]`; macOS
`launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/io.hagency.services` — **bootout before
removing that plist too**). Check: native `/ready` ok; retained units
inactive; port map: 8090/8084 dark, 13300 serving loopback. **This is the
point past which rollback to the JS service as the authority is refused** —
the retirement is the authority handover (M9's "one active authority owns
each deployment, Matrix device, queue and database", plan `:396-398`).
Evidence: the retirement log, the final port check.

**What CI can prove** (the spec scenarios): against a temp state directory,
a dry-run of the runbook's checks — version identity, ready gate, stop
contract (SIGTERM → 503/exit shape), and pending-preserved across the
stop-start pair — without either init system.

## Consequences

Good, because every forward step has a named check, a named rollback, and
named evidence; the refusal point (end of step 5) is explicit; the macOS
bootout ordering and the migration-head fence are concrete, not principles.
Bad, because the runbook is long, and its value depends on the operator
actually recording the evidence rather than skipping to step 8.

## Alternatives Considered

- An importer-based cutover preserving the existing deployment — rejected
  for the first cutover (the plan's own default; the importer is a
  separately gated option).
- Dual-running both services during acceptance — rejected: "No unattended
  dual-writer phase is proposed" (plan `:394`); acceptance runs against the
  native service with the retained side drained.
- A generic runbook not naming the ports, head, or refusal point — rejected:
  the review's findings exist precisely because those details were missing.
