# ADR-046: Typed Codex approval coordination before native cutover

- Status: Accepted for offline implementation; live native approval cutover remains gated
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Requirements: REQ-OWNER-UI-APPROVAL, REQ-EXECUTION-AUTHORIZATION, REQ-RUST-MIGRATION-EXECUTION
- Related: ADR-032/034 native protocol/session, ADR-039 execution scopes, ADR-043 durable owner approvals

## Context

Native Codex permission callbacks must consume an exact durable owner decision without mistaking protocol resolution for actual permission application.

## Decision

Keep `hagency-runtime` independent of the domain database. The new
`hagency-permissions` crate owns one validated Codex `SessionDriver`, its current
host capability, and the schema13 `DomainStore` approval API. No HTTP setter or
runtime JSON field can select the host connection, Hagency identity, owner room,
workspace lease, or verdict.

The host explicitly attaches the coordinator after thread/turn startup. The
coordinator derives exact upstream thread/turn and cwd/read-only settings from
that session; the host supplies opaque context/connection/workspace-resource IDs.
The repository then proves the current full Matrix/private-owner binding,
canonical task epoch, dispatch fence and workspace lease. Writable contexts need
an exclusive clean lease; read-only contexts cannot become writable through an
upstream claim. Multi-environment and YOLO configuration remain refused.

The default `SessionDriver` and `OwnedSession` behavior continues to reject every
server request. Opt-in admits only bounded pinned request types. It emits a
private parsed event, then the coordinator asks the single repository writer to
persist the request and park its dispatch. Owner verdicts remain a separate
authenticated private-room host observation, including all schema13 revocation
and shared-room fences. Runtime requests never synthesize owner decisions.

`apply` consumes the exact durable decision before constructing/sending any
response bytes. The application descriptor is checked against the owned
connection/request/thread/turn/item. Runtime's typed response object has no
Deserialize or arbitrary-result constructor. The connection checks the complete
original method/params and exact JSON-RPC ID and permits one response, retaining
the pending scope until upstream resolution. Numeric and string IDs are distinct.
Schema13 cannot represent negative numeric IDs; the coordinator refuses those
without string coercion. Requests are bounded to 64 KiB, at most 16 retained
coordinator approvals per turn, and existing connection/event/deadline bounds.

## Pinned request-specific responses

Local `codex-cli 0.153.4` generated schemas were inspected offline with
`codex app-server generate-json-schema --experimental`. The official release tag
`rust-v0.153.4` resolves to commit
`3d2ee51ca2d5db578f328aa75e20aa22c0197c9a`.

| Request | Once allow | Deny |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` | `{"decision":"accept"}` | `{"decision":"decline"}` |
| `item/fileChange/requestApproval` | `{"decision":"accept"}` | `{"decision":"decline"}` |
| `item/permissions/requestApproval` | exact requested supported profile with `"scope":"turn"` | empty profile with `"scope":"turn"` |

An owner “once” verdict for a permission-profile request authorizes that explicit
turn-scoped profile once; it does not claim each subsequent command will ask
again. Task/always choices remain Hagency's scoped durable rules, never Codex
`acceptForSession`, session profiles, exec-policy amendments, or network-policy
amendments. Command requests offering no exact accept/decline pair, writeStdin,
file grantRoot, filesystem special/glob/deny entries, malformed/future fields,
and unsupported methods fail closed. Literal file paths are shape-checked by the
runtime; reusable scope normalization stays exclusively in core/store.

File and explicit permission requests can precede `item/started`. Their exact
callback item is bound as upstream correlation data without inventing an active
item or converting that value to host task/session identity. The pinned
[request creation paths](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/3d2ee51ca2d5db578f328aa75e20aa22c0197c9a/codex-rs/app-server/src/bespoke_event_handling.rs#L640)
show why requiring every item to have started would reject valid requests.

## Resolution is not application acknowledgment

This is established from source, not inferred from schema names. For command,
file, and permission callbacks, Codex awaits the response channel, sends
`serverRequest/resolved`, and only then parses the selected typed response and
submits the core operation. Errors, callback drops and turn-transition
cancellation also traverse this resolution path. See the pinned
[file/command handlers](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/3d2ee51ca2d5db578f328aa75e20aa22c0197c9a/codex-rs/app-server/src/bespoke_event_handling.rs#L2011),
[permission handler](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/3d2ee51ca2d5db578f328aa75e20aa22c0197c9a/codex-rs/app-server/src/bespoke_event_handling.rs#L1885),
[cancellation path](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/3d2ee51ca2d5db578f328aa75e20aa22c0197c9a/codex-rs/app-server/src/outgoing_message.rs#L185),
and [resolution emission](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/3d2ee51ca2d5db578f328aa75e20aa22c0197c9a/codex-rs/app-server/src/request_processors/thread_lifecycle.rs#L848).

Consequently flush and observed resolution never record native Applied. The
original offline coordinator records Uncertain and does not yet use schema22
router authorization; its execution integration remains a separate gate. Failed
writes and explicit close also record Uncertain. Dropping a started async operation closes the owned
session. If a database response or async uncertainty observation is lost,
Applying survives and becomes Uncertain on repository reopen; neither state can
be consumed again. Resolution before a decision closes the session so a later
owner approval cannot answer the cancelled callback. Stable duplicate owner
verdicts remain repository receipts, not permission to resend bytes.

No model text, item completion, turn completion, generic callback termination,
or empty stdin queue supplies native application proof. A host inspector or
upstream protocol extension would need to bind the exact request and selected
decision/profile to a core acknowledgment after actual application, distinguishing
cancellation. Merely moving notification after `submit` proves queue admission.

### Accepted router-authorization amendment (2026-09-11)

The root approved ADR043's schema22 domain prerequisite after comparing the
retained requirement for router application before allow delivery with the
original router implementation. Interactive continuation may use exact durable
router authorization and the original one-shot typed response while native
application remains unconfirmed. No post-core acknowledgement is required to
authorize that router continuation, and no Applied evidence is fabricated.

The retained original runtime owner must prepare its exact callback/response,
obtain positive acknowledgement of the fresh one-shot response-admission
transaction, then send that response once under its original bounded deadline.
Only that transaction can resume the same attempt after every current approval
barrier has router authorization. Resolution observed before response admission
cancels the callback. Uncertain transmission closes/fences the original attempt;
unknown consumption or admission acknowledgements never permit reconstruction or
resend. After known local write acceptance, callback resolution remains native
application-unconfirmed and does not by itself revoke current router authority.
Future application inspection only adds evidence; it cannot rearm a response or
revive parked, expired, retired or successor execution.

The active domain contract is `specs/task-rust-approval-router-authority.spec.md`.
Runtime pumping, finite parked maintenance, actual typed transmission, owner UI
integration and executable qualification remain explicit separate gates. No
timeout, sandbox, YOLO or production-cutover change follows from this domain task.

## Verification and limits

Regression fixtures use real SQLite/domain authority plus bounded duplex streams.
A writer inspects durable Applying on the first response-byte attempt. Tests
cover request-specific mappings, exact IDs/body/threads, default refusal,
revoked grants, read-only scope, failed transactions, duplicate application,
multiple pending approvals, resolution before/after decision, write failure,
future cancellation and restart. These prove domain/protocol sequencing; they do
not prove a live Codex permission was applied or an OS sandbox was enforced.

No Matrix cards/sends, automatic process attachment, live model, runner cutover,
new taskless path, or operational grant compaction is enabled. Requests racing
startup before the validated turn response remain refused. This is a bounded
integration seam, not completed native approval feature parity.

## Windows cancellation fixture correction

Native CI run 34539380960, Windows job 103078328251, failed at revision c0afefc
in `native_codex_approval_uncertainty_write_cancel_restart`: its final `seen`
assertion was false. The original log did not label the loop mode or capture the
instruction schedule. This establishes a failed fixture assertion, not a proven
production write-loss or shutdown defect. Every other original Windows test
target passed, including the three ADR062 owned Matrix workflow tests. The later
serial Matrix/Palpo diagnostic also passed; it did not rerun the failed approval
selector and does not replace the original failed verdict.

The cancellation branch had a concrete phase race: its 30 ms timer covered both
awaiting durable approval consumption and the blocked native response write.
SQLite can commit Applying before the awaiting caller receives its application
descriptor. Cancellation at that point correctly closes the session with
`seen=false`, although the test asserted a byte attempt must already have
occurred. The existing real `attach_and_consume_lost_response` fixture proves
that exact valid state by holding the transaction briefly, polling the actual
operation once, observing its real committed row, and dropping it without a
further poll. It passed both the original Windows job and the local check.

The corrected blocked-write case polls the real operation under the existing
2 second fixture handshake bound until WireGate verifies durable Applying and
reports the first write attempt. Only then does it begin the same 30 ms
cancellation interval. The future is dropped exactly once after timeout, with
no canceled-future repoll. Completion or failure before the gate is an explicit
test failure; mode labels identify the failed subcase. Closed-session, Applying,
restart-to-Uncertain and no-duplicate-application assertions remain intact.
Production runtime/store deadlines, permission semantics and cleanup guarantees
are unchanged. Local macOS success and Windows cross-compilation cannot establish
that the corrected fixture passes actual Windows CI; that remains an integration
gate. No missing Applied proof or native approval cutover is inferred.

## Consequences

Native application stays Applying or Uncertain until qualified application
evidence exists. The new domain layer permits exact router continuation after
its unique response-admission acknowledgement without claiming that application
evidence. The existing offline coordinator does not use this new authority and
cannot resume an approval-parked attempt. Owned runtime integration and actual
interactive qualification remain separate gates; offline mapping and
cancellation fixtures do not enable live approval cutover or weaken default
request refusal.

## Alternatives Considered

Treating serverRequest/resolved or a flushed response as Applied would contradict the pinned callback ordering. Session-wide acceptance or policy amendments would widen the recorded once/task/always scope mappings.

### Accepted original owned coordinator integration (2026-09-11)

The root approved a distinct execution-owned integration of the cooperative
runtime pump and schema22 unique router grants. Report retains original callback
frames, a separate admission batch and uncertain observations alongside the
actual OwnedSession. Every domain future stays pinned across control updates.
New observed callbacks must be persisted as barriers before any original unsent
response can continue. Local write acceptance consumes transmit admission;
callback resolution and native application evidence remain independent. The
old standalone SessionDriver coordinator stays an offline compatibility seam.

Only an explicit shared host policy enables this owned integration. Owner cutoff,
domain expiry, prepared response deadline and the original operation end remain
fixed; response reserve never revives an expired domain decision. Actual private
Matrix request delivery and encrypted executable qualification are separate
root-owned gates. No sandbox or timeout ceiling changes are authorized here.
The active 28-path contract is `specs/task-rust-owned-approval-coordinator.spec.md`;
implementation and qualification are in progress.

### Coordinator partition qualification (2026-09-11)

The accepted task is implemented and qualified across its final29 paths, which
include only two exhaustive bootstrap failure labels beyond the original28.
Final strict lifecycle passes the full boundary and all eight selectors (9/9),
with11 distinct actual regression tests. Complete affected-package records pass
316 tests, plus the bootstrap projection. Native warnings-denied Clippy and
Windows GNU all-target compilation pass; actual Windows execution and complete
private SDK/MCP service integration remain outside this partition. Earlier failed
fixtures and the pre-fix usage-slot negative control remain preserved in the
external migration cache. No synthetic Applied or production-cutover claim is made.
